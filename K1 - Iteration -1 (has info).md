**K1** is the sole **Shatter** of **Iteration -1**, also known as **The Stickworld**. They commonly appear in the form of a void-figure that has a 'divine eye' - the signifier of **Shatters** and **Shades** in **Iteration -1** - but in the current timelines, **K1** is actually in **Iteration 0** in the form of a human. **K1** no longer has amnesia, but was split in two leaving a being called Echo in their place as **Shatter** of **The Stickworld**. This change has now been reverted, and K1 is once again in place. 

* **Shades** and **Vengeful**
     **Shades:**
     **Shades**, when serving under **K1**, commonly have a 'divine eye' and golden engravings cast into the skin. The patterns are placed in an orderly fashion, centring in a ring around the chest, just below the ribs. They then lead out from the ring to the extremities in straight lines, following the centre of the limb they are following.

     **Vengeful:**
     **Vengeful** which serve under **Shades** of **K1** usually have the distinctive markings of a **Shade** when identifying them, such as the golden engravings. These patterns, however, do not manifest fully in a **Vengeful** of **K1**, and so they usually have missing limbs with patterns rotating slowly around where the limb would be. The energy entering a **Vengeful**'s body upon its ascension is so great in **K1**'s case that it is guaranteed that **Vengeful** will lose the physical form of anything from their left hand, to their entire body.

* Background:
     **K1** was a post-**Shattered**-**One** creation from **The True One**. Shortly after creation, **K1** was sent to **Iteration 0**, where they stayed for several decades. This is how **K1** speaks fluent Authqeli, and has a non-strenuous relationship with **Rationality**, the **Shatter** of **Iteration 0**.
     
     After leaving **Iteration 0**, **K1** created a host of **Shades** using reanimated husks found in his small carving of the **Void**. Using these, they created the first void-figures, imbuing the husks with many magnitudes less power than before. It was at this time that the arrival of souls from the mortal plane began possessing husks.
     
     These he called 'stick-figures', due to not wishing to reveal the true nature of their existence. Though he had not imbued them with any power, they rivalled minor **Vengeful** from the beginning. They gained a gift of life, granting them five chances at survival, and an unbelievably fast reaction time. This was not a problem for **K1**, however, as he just reset the Iteration once one got any 'big ideas'. 
     
     Eventually this came to a head when fighting a mechanical creation meant to mimic them. **K1**'s idea was to use the full power of a **Shatter** to absorb the being into him, however, the 'time machine' found in the Cultist Base (a minor place of operations for a group that worshipped him knowing he was a **Shatter**) released all of its energy due to time itself being paused for long periods. The energy sent the entirety of **The Stickworld** into a connection/collision with the **True Void**, and sending **K1** to **Iteration 0** again, repeating the story. But this time, the souls have a say in what happens.

* Relationships:
     **K1** currently has a natural friendship with living-soul-possessed void figures, leading to many of them gaining power throughout their stay in **Iteration -1**.

     K1 has an alliance/romantic - or sexual, unknown - relationship with the **Shatter** of **Iteration 0**, **Rationality**. This came about through **K1**'s long stay in **Iteration 0**, but beyond going to **Iteration -1**, **K1** has not visited **Rationality** in person after his second fall into the Iteration.
