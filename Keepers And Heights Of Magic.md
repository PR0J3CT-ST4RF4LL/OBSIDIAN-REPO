Height Of Magic:
A magical device imbued with the energy of a **Shade**'s Soul after they pass in battle against a **Shatter**. It takes the form of a cubic tesseract contained within 6 golden lattices - one one each side - and grants the ability, when opened and consumed, to learn a magic system from an Iteration you did not originate from. Usually given by a Keeper to those who perform orders relative to the safety of the Iterations as a whole.

Keeper:
A **Shatter** that holds at least 1 Height Of Magic that they have not consumed. They are required to 'keep' Heights Of Magic and lock them safely away within pocket dimensions so that they do not fall into the wrong hands.

List of Keepers in order of Heights Of Magic stored:
* **Vee**
* **K1**
* **Eclipse**
