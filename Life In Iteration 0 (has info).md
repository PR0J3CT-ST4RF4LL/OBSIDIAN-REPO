 *  Cuisine
     Due to Iteration 0's freezing temperatures, the main forms of sustenance is in the form of soups and stews, the recipes taught to children as young as 5 rotations to prepare them for the outside world. As life outside of civilisation is quite hostile, most of the population resides in large cities close to running water, which doesn't freeze.
    
     The daily food intake of a denizen consists of mainly root vegetables, which they both cook and ferment into alcoholic beverages. In addition to the natural preservation by freezing, denizens in the South will pickle vegetables to modify flavour. Although one might expect denizens to only eat these vegetables, their diet also consists of breads, berries, dairy - from thick-haired bovine animals, eggs, and honey.
     The bread is created using a grain that grows perennially in the a warmer South, while the berries  grow in the North, making it the only place where the bees can be found, the honey and berries both being huge food exports from the North.
     The bovines can be found relatively commonly upon the entire landmass due to the increased vegetation while birds are mostly located in the North, eating the aforementioned berries and even other birds.
     In addition to these ingredients, they eat a translucent-blue plant which contains menthol. The 'signature dish' of Aranduale is a roasted red meat with a side of this plant. In addition, the plant is used in tea by boiling out the menthol, leaving a sweet taste.

* Civilisations
     The oldest civilisation in Iteration 0 is known as Olm - or the City of Olm - as it resides next to the greatriver Olm. It likely survived the deadly Winters due to the geothermal springs which are common deep in the mountains on which Olm stands. In a financial sense, Olm is in a prime spot for exporting materials; its (comparably) warm environment allows for the growing of reeds and garlic near the hot springs. This directly correlates to the larger amount of aristocrats in Olm.
