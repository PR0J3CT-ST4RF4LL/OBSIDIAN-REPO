Daemonology refers to the practice of summoning creatures known as 'demons', or observing their species. This can range from passive observation, to being an integral part of their isolated society. As such, all demons naturally have the True Void magic system of Daemonology, and are taught how to use it at a young age. Daemonology as a magic system was late in being recognised as individual, as it is a conglomeration of various parts of other magic systems. Only sections of magic systems relative to summoning demons, or are known to be spells, incantations, (et cetera) that demons can or do use, are considered to be part of Daemonology as a magic system. It would, perhaps, be more fair to call Daemonology more of an art form, or hobby, rather than a magic system in and of itself, but that point has been argued time and time again.

*Demons, as a race:*
Despite the name, demons are not overtly hostile creatures necessarily. It would be considered racist of one to think so. The name comes from their classical name for which they were known during the period of time before The End (see Iterations History). During that time, they were depicted as brutal and merciless creatures. Though this has sadly imparted this behaviour on some of their kind, the majority of demon civilisation are relatively peaceful, and live in grand underground cities within the True Void, though that may differ from demon to demon. Interestingly, demons are one of the only races, or even creatures as a whole, to escape The End, since their separate dimension - which was previously known as the Nightmare Realm - was integrated into a portion of the True Void. This portion now goes by the same name. Due to their unique position, demons are actually among on of the most cosmopolitan species in all the Iterations. As per technicality, demons are able to visit a section of the True Void carved off by **K1**, which is therefore Iteration -1 within that area. The location is known as Hell (because of course it is) and consists of nine layers of varying environments and climates. Demons have made this location a form of 'secondary habitat', and there is currently at least one demon-ruled city in each layer.

In reality, there is only one true problem with demon-kind as a whole, and that is their tendency to view races other than their own as objects, or sub-human animals, something to be owned and used for a purpose. This isn't the fault of every demon, of course, but speaking broadly, this would be what one would consider their 'fatal flaw'. Many demons take members of other races as pets or 'partners' and use coercion and magic to subjugate them into obeying. This has lead to the rise of large corporations in the 'slave trade' business - though they wouldn't call themselves that. These companies sell off 'tamed' members of other races for a wealthy buyer's pleasure or workforce. Though this trade could be seen as highly unethical, insight has found that the 'pets' are treated rather well. They are given adequate food and drink, living spaces, and leisure times before being sold off, as even though the slave trade is a thriving business, it is a legal one, and so operates under strict moral and ethical guidelines, even if it's questionable to legalise slavery to begin with. The subjugated races often find their new place in life rather comforting, and this has been found to not be just a result of subjugation. Their owners are chosen under a strict vetting policy, so any buyer has many forms to fill out, and can face death as a penalty for taking in subjugated individuals without proper precautions.

Demonic architecture is not too dissimilar from elven architecture, with large, elegant structures of stone, often carved into the sides of mountains. The major difference is that, while elves prefer marble and quartz as building materials, demons prefer ilmenite, magnetite, and obsidian. It seems a purposeful contrast, as many demons are aware of the similarities between elven and demonic architecture. This convergent design seems to have emerged on the demonic side long before elves existed, however, and in conferences with the demonic 'High Emperor' of today, Nightmare, it has been revealed that they had been using these techniques and materials millennia before The End, when they lived within their own realm, known as the Nightmare Realm (Aptly named, of course, but the name of the realm came long before High Emperor Nightmare). Since their realm was filled with these dark stones, they grew used to using them, and, upon their transition to the Iterations, and to the True Void, they became similarly attached to the voidstone that could be harvested from the ground there. Even in terms of spellcasting, summoning rituals that summon demons often require either a shard of obsidian or a piece of voidstone to function, and most rituals performed by demons require the same materials as well.

*Demonic species:*
The creatures known as 'demons', as previously mentioned, are a conglomeration of various different species. These species often mingle and live in harmony with each other, and thus they are grouped together. The differences in demon physiology, however, can vary greatly from species to species, so knowing your demon types before entering their civilisations can be important, as they may become offended if a visitor is ignorant. Below are listed the known different species. There may be more that have been missed.
* Sleep Paralysis Demon:
     These were a classic before The End. Sleep paralysis demons usually have dark, greyish skin and can be found with indistinct facial features. Some can also be found with more typical demon features such as horns or sharp teeth. These demons visit creatures in their sleep and wake them. They can choose to emit a pheromone which paralyses the body but leaves the mind untouched. The demons will then copulate with the victim in an attempt to produce offspring. Usually, a sleep paralysis demon will choose to visit creatures of the opposite sex to it in an attempt to reproduce, but sleep paralysis demons have the highest chance of being hermaphroditic, and possessing both sexual organs, in which case they will choose their target indiscriminately.
     
     Upon 'finishing' copulation, the sleep demon (common abbreviation) will then put the target back to sleep before leaving. Usually, conception is unsuccessful due to varying timing issues, but upon successful conception (in a biological female's case where the female is not the demon), the victim is likely to die before birth due to the lack of necessary nutrients, as sleep demon children are resource-intensive. In addition, hermaphroditic sleep demons may lay a 'clutch' of eggs inside of a fertile female instead of traditional reproduction. This form has a much higher chance of killing a female, as the demon can lay up to 120 eggs inside the average body, which all feed off of the host's nutrients.
     
     In terms of daily life, sleep demons are actually the least likely to keep slaves, and often prefer to perform the traditional 'hunt' instead. They can be kind, but are most often detached from morality, and are commonly indifferent to others' problems, either through direct or accidental means. They are known to usually be slightly physically stronger than most humans, and so are useful in manual labour jobs.
     
     A famous example of sleep paralysis demons is High Emperor Nightmare, who possesses lineage specific traits and is a prime example of a hermaphroditic clutch-producing demon.

*Demonic relationships with other races:*
To explain demonic relationships, I would have to first explain several demonic features, as well as the High Emperor's relations with their own lover, who is human.

The genetic line of High Emperor Nightmare has the innate ability of drugged saliva. Their saliva contains varying amounts of aphrodisiac drugs, as well as other substances capable of subjugating a person's will. There is no lethal dose for the saliva, but consuming too much will lead you to be completely under the will of the demon the saliva belongs to. When consumed in moderation, the saliva increases libido production in the body, leading to sudden arousal. Slight excesses of this amount can result in depressive effects. Symptoms of this are usually: sensitivity to light, spotty vision, with random objects flashing a bright blue-ish white at random intervals, and an inability to disobey any orders from the demon the saliva belongs to. This saliva has addictive properties which lead the victim to constantly wish to be near the demon the saliva belongs to, and may lead to the victim's eternal subjugation by the demon. This is due to the fact that consuming the saliva also extends a body's duration, increasing fertility and lifespan indefinitely if consumed semi-regularly. Further examination has revealed that certain pheromones in the saliva react with the body, leading to the body's production of an altered variant of embryonic stem cells (cells produced automatically match the victim's original species). This has a variety of effects. For example, it leads to the continued production of female gametes in humans, which are usually restricted in amount at birth.

As a rule, no type of demon is the same as another type of demon. There are many different types of demons, with many anatomical differences between them. The connection to call the entire group 'demons' even seems to be a purely human invention, which originated in a time before The End. This unfortunate name stuck, and so even the collection of species themselves call each other demons, and prefer to be called demons by other races as well. Anatomical differences can include differences in the sex organs, as well as a multitude of other differences. To simplify things, demons are regarded as having four sexes. Male, Female, Hermaphrodite, and Androgynous. The male and female sexes are self-explanatory, but the other two may require further explanation.
* Hermaphrodite:
     A demon possessing both male and female sex organs. Most famously found in the genetic line of High Emperor Nightmare, and most commonly found in the species of demon known as Sleep Paralysis Demons, albeit infrequently.
     These demons may also, instead of producing regular gametes in their male sex organ, produce miniscule eggs that grow inside a female host. A common way of referring to these is a 'clutch'. These eggs are fertilised by the female gamete and latch onto the female host's insides, feeding off of their blood and nutrients within. The eggs then grow to roughly the size of cue balls, before being 'laid' by the female.
* Androgynous:
     A demon possessing no sex organs or gametes. These demons often mate through complex rituals which result in the appearance of a large egg containing an adolescent demon at the site of ritual. In addition, certain spells can transform androgynous demons into male or female demons through the physical changing of the body's anatomy and DNA, resulting in the appearance of a sex organ. Surprisingly, androgynous demons are not treated differently by other demons, despite the demonic civilisations heavy reliance on sexual conduct.

High Emperor Nightmare is a hermaphroditic clutch-producing sleep paralysis demon. They have an odd relationship with their human lover, as Nightmare initially brought her to the Nightmare Realm before The End, thus saving her from death. Nightmare shares 'custody' of their lover with the first demon ever born, the female succubus Lilith. Technically speaking, their lover is also their personal slave, as she is addicted to Nightmare's saliva. Despite this, she seems perfectly happy with her position with the demonic civilisations as the 'toy' of the High Emperor. Most of the demons that make up the demonic armies actually originate from her, as she is consistently able to produce over 100 fertilised eggs per clutch, leading to fast population growth, as well as a political advantage over any
