A list of basic information pertaining to each race in any Iteration.

**Humans:**

Humans are known to populate a vast majority of Iterations across time and space. They possess quite a basic understanding of the world around them and have relatively low average LE scores.

* Extended information:
     * Subraces:
         Human:
         Your basic, all-natural human.
    
         Variant Human:
         A more skilled and proficient outlier in the race. Usually take the form of prodigies and renowned weapons-masters.

**Elves:**

Elves are sparser in population density and the amount of Iterations they inhabit compared to humanity. They are more likely to be chosen as **Vengeful** or **Shades** and possess a generally higher average LE compared to humanity. Most elves have some brief and basic understanding of **Vengeful** and **Shades**, despite a majority not being aware of the **Shatters**, instead opting to worship false gods created to fill gaps in knowledge.

* Extended information:
     * Subraces:
         High Elf:
         The classical elf, commonly found in large, ornate cities formed of white stones. A prowess for weaponry, diplomacy, and language make the high elf a wonderful jack-of-all-trades.
    
         Wood Elf:
         Another classic depiction of elf-kind. Usually found roaming throughout nature, though no less civilised than the high elves at most times. An awareness of their surroundings makes them very fast on their feet.
    
         Sea Elf:
         A rarer subrace of the elves only found in large, warm oceans. Sea elves possess gills which allow them to breathe both in water and on land, making them masters of oceanic travel and deadly guerrilla fighters if fighting in deep water.
    
         Dark Elf:
         An uncommon sight in an elf city is a dark elf. They are commonly spotted in crowds due to their skin tone contrasting against even other elves. They have learned to hide in the dark places, and this has made them adept fighters, but their affinity for light has diminished due to this and so they have terrible vision in the day.
    
         Astral Elf:
         Not known to exist within the Iterations, an astral elf city has proved a rare sight for those who dare to traverse the **True Void**. Chosen to be the guardians of the deepest secrets of the darkness, they choose knowledge as their weapon, being adept in the magics of the **True Void**.

**Warforged:**

Warforged are an exceedingly rare occurrence upon most Iterations, being found most commonly in **Anthravuil**, and even there they are a unique commodity. Warforged have little to no LE as most are created by denizens with little knowledge on **Shatters** or even **Vengeful**.

* Extended information:
     * Subraces:
         Eternal Forge:
         A massive, hulking form comprised of various mechanical parts of unknown design. The warforged of the eternal forge seem to be a creation sent from the **Shatters** themselves, or even possibly a higher being. They are exceedingly rare, having little to no presence in the Iterations. No one knows where they live or call home. They are heavily resistant to attacks from **Shades** and **Vengeful**.
    
         Blazing Forge:
         A warforged of the blazing forge has a inset in their chest where sits a large, glowing fire set behind a metal grate. Warforged may blast this fire out of their bodies dealing grievous burns to those nearby. Their fire also grants them a torch-like ability to see through the dark close to them.
    
         Deathly Forge:
         Found rarely in astral elf cities in the **True Void**, these are warforged created for the sole purpose  of fighting. They exude deadly black gas from pores across their face-plate and torso, as well as extremities. They can shoot this gas at opponents much like the blazing forge does with its fire. Not much is known of warforged of the deathly forge, even among **Shatters**. 

**Changelings:**

Changelings, while a rarer occurrence than elves or humans in Iterations, are known to be the most common race chosen to be **Shades** or **Vengeful**, as their transformative abilities allow them to outwit **Shades** and **Vengeful** from other Iterations. Their LE is quite high compared to most other races; they are commonly known to perform occult rituals directly to the **Shatters** that rule their Iteration.

* Extended information:

**Owlins:**

Owlins are not an uncommon appearance across Iterations, but they aren't a common one either. Dependent on the Iteration, one might only find one type of owlin inhabit an area. Owlins have approximately the same LE as humans or elves, dependent on the Iteration.

* Extended information:
     * Subraces:
         Snowy Owlin:
         These owlins have a thick layer of densely-packed, white feathers to keep the cold out. They mostly inhabit cold forested areas, in which they build large and elaborate nests from fallen branches. They are a social creature, and tend to live in vast networks of these dwellings, occasionally spanning the entire forest.
    
         Desert Owlin:
         Contrasting to snowy owlins, desert owlins live in dry, arid areas, primarily alone in shallow caves. Their feathers have small holes on their ends, from which they dispense sweat that  has built up throughout the day. During the night, the feathers become matted, and cling close to the skin of the owlin, warming it.
    
         Adept Owlin:
         Adept owlins are the most capable of any of the owlin subraces. They possess a larger wingspan, as well as the ability to carry other creatures smaller than them. They are predominantly found in small amounts in other owlin civilisations, but groups of them have been found living separately in tall, coniferous woods.
    
         Feylike Owlin:
         The feylike owlins are not easy to fool. They are directly descended from the giant owls of which few remain now. They are the fastest flyers of any owlin and have eyes as keen as an eagle's. They fly so fast, that opponents will not even see them attack, before they fall to the ground, with an owlin flying off into the distance. They are the rarest of the owlins, and no one has successfully found a nest and lived to tell the tale.

**Felinae:**

Felinae are much the same as Owlins, where they may appear as only one form across an Iteration. They possess a cat-like appearance, much like larger felines but for several exceptions, including bipedal nature and sapience, as well as the ability to speak the common tongue of an Iteration on most occasions. Their LE is about the same as a human's.

* Extended information:

**Incogni:**

Incogni are much the same as warforged in the fact that they are both non-biological, however, incogni are unique in the fact that they each have a 3-digit serial code that, if spoken aloud, the incogni to whom the number belongs will immediately collapse to the ground, lifeless. They are somehow able to recall the code no matter the state of consciousness they are in, such as having amnesia. Their heads float above their body on non-existent necks, held up seemingly by some sort of unique magic or technology. Incogni generally have a mass stigma for being watched, and a taboo on watching others without consent.

**Void-Figures:**

A name for the sole denizens of Iteration -1. Void-Figures are not known to populate any Iterations outside of their original Iteration. Oddly, they are able to travel between Iterations via the **True Void** due to the closeness between **K1**, their **Shatter**, and **The True One**. Void-Figures are unable to enter water due to being comprised of an ink-like substance that dissipates when interacting with liquids, and as such they carry a general disdain for it. Void-Figures do not seem to require food, sleep, or aforementioned water as they do not possess natural souls, instead being those of the deceased across other Iterations. As they are usually formed from the dead souls of other Iterations, most other denizens have a general disdain and/or fear of Void-Figures.
They have been known to have extraordinarily high LE, exceeding that of even Changelings at points, and can even harbour living souls from the mortal plane as their hosts.
