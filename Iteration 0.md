**Anthravuil:**

**Anthravuil**, also known as Iteration 0, is trapped in an endless Winter, and is home to one **Shatter**, **Rationality**, which holds the planet in a perpetual state of self-reflection. Its denizens are not known to be the hosts of many **Shades** or **Vengeful**. The denizens speak the language of **Authqeli**, a fair speech known for a flowing manner of speaking, sometimes referred to as the ‘echoes of a cold wind down from the mountain’, which is the direct translation of the language’s name. No expedition to venture outside of the Winter has proved successful, so it is widely believed that the entire planet is in this wintery state.
