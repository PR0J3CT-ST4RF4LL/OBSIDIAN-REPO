In the True Void, every environment is controlled by a core called the Nexus, situated in the depths of **Vee**'s fortress. All beings with this magic system have the ability to transmit data to the Nexus, physically changing the environment of the True Void. In addition, the mega-cities of the True Void harness the power of the Nexus - which flows through the Iteration in giant radioactive ore veins that stretch to the size of continents - to augment city plans to create complex grid-like fractal patterns that move autonomously according to each citizen's need.

*Neuroforgers:*
Before the construction of the Nexus Channel, a device housed within **Vee**'s fortress, the strongest users of this magic system - known colloquially as a cult called the Neuroforgers - used to travel to the Nexus and perform rituals around it in order to process the data they would enter. This process of connecting to the Nexus would commonly result in severe brain damage to the Neuroforgers, causing them to become a part of the system itself, in death fulfilling a role much like Random Access Memory within the Nexus, storing the next requests yet to be processed.

Neuroforgers commonly revered the process of becoming part of the Nexus, and so after the annual pilgrimage to the Nexus, only 50% of the Neuroforgers would return to their civilisations, with the rest staying at the Nexus and processing data, slowly becoming part of the system. By the year's end - when the next pilgrimage would reach the Nexus - all the Neuroforgers that were left at the Nexus would have become part of the system. As a record from the year the Nexus Channel was created, there are roughly 2,700,000 bodies within the catacombs that make up the Nexus' containment, with roughly 1,350,000 of those bodies making up the very walls, floors, and ceilings of the caverns, being condensed over time into mineral-dense rock. Within these bone-rocks were carved numerous cabinets, in which were stored the other 50% of bodies.

Outside of the Nexus catacombs, Neuroforgers possess the ability to bypass the request system in the Nexus, transmitting their desired changes directly to the landscape. As such, Neuroforgers in the present are a carefully monitored and controlled group of people who primarily reside in **Vee**'s fortress, and function as their police force or military.
