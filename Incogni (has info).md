**Incogni:**

Incogni are much the same as warforged in the fact that they are both non-biological, however, incogni are unique in the fact that they each have a 3-digit serial code that, if spoken aloud, the incogni to whom the number belongs will immediately collapse to the ground, lifeless. They are somehow able to recall the code no matter the state of consciousness they are in, such as having amnesia. Their heads float above their body on non-existent necks, held up seemingly by some sort of unique magic or technology. Incogni generally have a mass stigma for being watched, and a taboo on watching others without consent.
