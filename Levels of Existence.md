Levels of Existence, or shortened to LE, define how far above the **Chain of Existence** an individual can see. The higher the LE, the more they understand the true functions of the world around them. Individuals higher up the **Chain of Existence** can fully perceive any being lower in the chain than them.

* Chain of Existence:

     (The Chain of Existence also functions as a form of power-gauging system to assess individuals’ power.)

     From top to bottom, in order of more LE needed to less.

    * The True One – Creator of all existence, the gateway interactions between the regular world and the Iterations.

     * Project Eclipse – A direct creation of The True One, set to sow the seeds of a plan lasting eons. Eclipse is not set to follow the instructions of their creator, rather to be the enemy of the Shatters, to ‘put them in their place’. They were formed after landing in a blank canvas of an Iteration long left forgotten specifically to house them. They were able to escape and seek to take revenge on the Shatters, who are the pieces of The Shattered One and thus responsible for their actions.

     * K1 – A direct creation of The True One, created after the death of The Shattered One. K1 was created to rule as a modified Shatter over the Stickworld Iteration. They are the equivalent of a Shade to The True One.

     * The Shattered One – A direct creation of The True One. Created the planets, stars, and entire universe. At the point of its creation, there were no Iterations, only one continuous universe.

     * A Shatter – A part of The Shattered One. These are the gods of individual Iterations. Upon The Shattered One’s death, the Shatters were scattered across the universe, separating it into many Iterations. Some Shatters are collective in their governing of an Iteration. All Shatters are equal in power. Shatters are not aware of The True One’s existence and thus the information has not descended beyond this point of the Chain of Existence.

     * A Shade – A direct result of a Shatter’s influence on the denizens of an Iteration. These are the corpses of individuals who have had their soul pass to the border of the Iteration, and then be forced back into its original body. These Shades have mastery over part or the entirety of an Iteration’s magic system, dependent on the amount of Shatters in the Iteration. Shades can pass between Iterations through the True Void to carry out the will of their Shatter (the one which purposefully carried the soul back to its body), but usually stay in their Iteration, as other Shades are usually hostile to Shades from other Iterations from themselves. The favoured species to become a Shade is a Changeling, or other species that can change their form. A Shatter's favourite Shades are usually colloquially called the Shatter's 'Sword' and 'Shield', dependent on the acts the Shade does for their Shatter.

     * A Vengeful – A Shade’s equivalent to a Shade. Formed when a Shatter bestows power to a denizen through the use of one of its Shades. Vengeful have partial – if not full – mastery over the magic system of their Iteration, dependent on the amount of Shatters in the Iteration. Vengeful can pass between Iterations through the True Void to carry out the will of their Shade or Shatter, but usually stay in their Iteration, as other Shades and Vengeful are usually hostile to Vengeful from other Iterations from themselves.

     * Denizens – The common folk of an Iteration. They usually have no knowledge of even a Vengeful’s existence. Denizens are usually more aware of the social concepts and troubles of the region they live in than even Vengeful originating from that same region, as denizens cannot and should not trouble themselves with ideas or concepts above them, while Vengeful must understand their Shade’s - and the Shade’s Shatter’s - will.
