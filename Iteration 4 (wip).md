**Malac**, the only planet optimal for supporting any form of life in **Iteration 4**, is a planet that, through rigorous experimentation in previous timelines, has had its Oxygen replaced with Chlorine in its atmosphere. The planet is mostly a desert, inhabited by sickly yellow plants and, upon the rare sighting of civilisation, humanity. This experiment, which caused the Chlorine disruption, is known as 'The Great Flood', in which a leakage within a facility which atomically transformed O2 atoms in the air into Chlorine through nuclear fusion with an unknown element with an atomic mass of 3 and an atomic number of 1. This Chlorine, since it is heavier than the little remaining Oxygen which floats above the Chlorine, forms great yellow-green clouds that coat surfaces in a white layer of dust. The fast winds on the planet of **Malac** caused the dust to grind against the mountains, slowly forming sand. Iteration 4 is interesting, because upon its restarting, it only reverts to the point at which the Chlorine leaked out upon the world.
