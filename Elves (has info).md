Elves are sparser in population density and the amount of Iterations they inhabit compared to humanity. They are more likely to be chosen as **Vengeful** or **Shades** and possess a generally higher average LE compared to humanity. Most elves have some brief and basic understanding of **Vengeful** and **Shades**, despite a majority not being aware of the **Shatters**, instead opting to worship false gods created to fill gaps in knowledge.

     * Subraces:
         High Elf:
         The classical elf, commonly found in large, ornate cities formed of white stones. A prowess for weaponry, diplomacy, and language make the high elf a wonderful jack-of-all-trades.
    
         Wood Elf:
         Another classic depiction of elf-kind. Usually found roaming throughout nature, though no less civilised than the high elves at most times. An awareness of their surroundings makes them very fast on their feet.
    
         Sea Elf:
         A rarer subrace of the elves only found in large, warm oceans. Sea elves possess gills which allow them to breathe both in water and on land, making them masters of oceanic travel and deadly guerrilla fighters if fighting in deep water.
    
         Dark Elf:
         An uncommon sight in an elf city is a dark elf. They are commonly spotted in crowds due to their skin tone contrasting against even other elves. They have learned to hide in the dark places, and this has made them adept fighters, but their affinity for light has diminished due to this and so they have terrible vision in the day.
    
         Astral Elf:
         Not known to exist within the Iterations, an astral elf city has proved a rare sight for those who dare to traverse the **True Void**. Chosen to be the guardians of the deepest secrets of the darkness, they choose knowledge as their weapon, being adept in the magics of the **True Void**.
