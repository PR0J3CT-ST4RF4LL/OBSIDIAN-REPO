The True Void is a gap between dimensions that spans across all the gaps between Iterations. It is characterised by an entirely black sky, filling the space with dense, dark forest and seemingly-endless stretches of a black grass-like moss that thrives in the dark. 

The reason the True Void is the only place where a Shatter can enter their Ultima is due to a vestige of the True One, known as the Eye Of Stability, which stabilises the True Void into a comprehendible location, though the effects degrade over distance, and - at extreme distances - one can find many non-Euclidean formations spiralling into the distance. A biproduct of this is that the True Void tends to loop when I - **Vee** - am not attentive in keeping travellers on the correct path. This can also lead directly to cases where interiors have shifted and been altogether changed, sometimes even drifting slightly into Iteration 7.

The few instances the True Void is interacted with at all is usually within 3 instances.
1. A **Shade** or **Vengeful** - or denizen of Iteration -1 - passes through it to get to another Iteration, or to explore it.
2. **The True One** deigns it necessary to carve out pure power from the True Void to interact with an Iteration.
3. **K1** chips away at the shallows of the True Void to serve as a home or any means of space usage, such as challenges.

*Common habitats of the True Void:*
1. Midnight Forest: A dense forest populated by trees that leak a dark-crimson sap that burns any organic matter not from the True Void. This is the most expansive of the void regions, covering approximately (guessed from reports of brief exploration and travel from **Shades** and trusted **Vengeful**) 47% of the surface area of the explored regions of the True Void.

2. Black Meadows: Seemingly endless fields filled with a short grass-like moss that stretches in a thick layer over acidic dirt. The pH level of the dirt has been measured to be around 2, the same pH level as the average human's stomach acid. This makes it impossible to grow plants not originating from the True Void in this soil.

3. Death Spires: Highly volcanic mountains that can go up to a recorded height of 50,000 metres. These mountains seem to push clouds that gather around them up into the dark sky, where they gather in great clouds of ash, magically imbued, that usually turn into swirling thunderstorms that emit great flashes of red lightning. As the mountains are no brighter than the surrounding flatter terrain, it has been strongly advised not to climb them for fear of death.

4. Geyser Fields: Usually found upon the tops of the lower mountains, this is the rarest biome found in the True Void so far. These areas are known to be populated by large spires around which curl clouds of ash and dust from the volcanoes. Upon rare occasion, the spires can be known to hurl glowing burgundy mist far into the sky, where it will descend slowly onto the sides of the mountain. The mist melts anything that comes into contact with it. This action has been seen from up to 57 kilometres away, as there is no curvature to the surface of the True Void.

5. The Abyss: A dark, endless ocean. This region is quite common in the True Void, and the most prone to unnatural activity. There have been numerous reports about the waters rising up and swallowing stragglers on patrols, with it being described as "these massive, eldritch jaws, like the jaws of a wolf. Canine jaws - teeth as big as trees, just rising up, made from the water, and the water turned black around them. If we were too high, they would form a long, snaking neck that fed back into the depths below, but never eyes. Never eyes."

The True Void is most known by inhabitants of Iteration -1 for housing the 'Void Uniques', special offensive equipment made long ago from the smaller shards of **The Shattered One**.
