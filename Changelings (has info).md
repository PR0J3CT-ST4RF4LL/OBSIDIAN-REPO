**Changelings:**

Changelings, while a rarer occurrence than elves or humans in Iterations, are known to be the most common race chosen to be **Shades** or **Vengeful**, as their transformative abilities allow them to outwit **Shades** and **Vengeful** from other Iterations. Their LE is quite high compared to most other races; they are commonly known to perform occult rituals directly to the **Shatters** that rule their Iteration.
