**The Stickworld:**

**The Stickworld** is an Iteration that was so far beyond the reach of the other Iterations that no **Shade** could traverse the **True Void** to get to it, partially due to **The True One**’s direct influence over its creation. **The Stickworld** has one **Shatter**, **K1**, which caused the land to appear as child-like artwork in its appearance to outsiders. The rest of the ‘gods’ of **The Stickworld** are, in fact, just **Shades**.

Due to **The True One**’s direct influence in the creation of this Iteration, denizens of **The Stickworld** are able to freely go between other Iterations, and even explore the **True Void** – to an extent, despite a vast majority not being **Shades**. In addition, original denizens of **The Stickworld** cannot age.
