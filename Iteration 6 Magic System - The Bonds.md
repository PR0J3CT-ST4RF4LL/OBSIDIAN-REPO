Iteration 6's magic system is unique in the fact that it relies on the connection to other beings to survive. This connection is usually between any traditional species with access to the Iteration 6 magic system and another creature, the Bond forming in two different ways, each granting their own different powers:

1. Between two traditional species:
     *Emotional Resonance* - The stronger the emotional bond between the individuals, the stronger their magic becomes. Deep trust fuels unbreakable defences, while intense passion fuels overwhelming attacks.
     *Sacrificial Revival* - If one individual is fatally wounded, the other can sacrifice a portion of their life force to bring them back, but at a steep personal cost.
     *Combined Essence* - The individuals can temporarily fuse into one being, blending their strengths and unlocking a unique hybrid transformation.
     *Eternal Bonding* - Even if one individual perishes, a fragment of their soul remains with the other, occasionally granting them echoes of their lost companion’s power.

2. Between a traditional species and one of the Deep Ones:
     *Bestial Synergy* - The traditional individual gains heightened senses, agility, and reflexes, and in battle, they can tap into their partner’s instincts, allowing for increased combat precision.
     *Celestial Echo* - Both individuals can see beyond the physical realm, detect unseen entities, and temporarily become intangible for a short time.
     *Nightmare Covenant* - The user’s shadow moves independently to attack or defend, and they can harness dark energy, feeding off of the emotions of enemies.

The latter is the rarest, forming only a couple times in a million denizens, though if a new **Shade** is selected as an individual without a connection, the second variety becomes more likely.

Dependent on the type of Connection (see below), as well as the form of the Bond (see above 3 variations), both sides of the connection gain different powers.
The different types of Connection and their powers are:

1. Guardian Bond:
     *Aegis Pact* - One individual can create barriers or forcefields around the other individual, and likewise the other way around.
     *Vigilant Link* - Both individuals can sense when the other is in danger and react with superhuman speed.
     *Retribution Strike* - The more one individual harm they take, the stronger the other's attacks become.
     *Guardian’s Echo* - Can briefly swap place with the bonded person to protect them.

2. Rival Bond:
     *Duellist’s Ascent* - As one individual grows stronger, so does the other.
     *Adrenaline Surge* - Either individual gains a burst of speed, strength, reflexes, or combination of such when at a disadvantage.
     *Mimicry Clash* - Either individuals can temporarily copy a skill or ability from the other.
     *Unyielding Resolve* - Both individuals gain a resistance to fatigue and mind-affecting magic.

3. Echo Bond:
     *Echo Manifestation* - The living individual may summon a spectral or energy-based avatar of the undead individual to assist in battle.
     *Soul Resonance* - The living individual may temporarily merge minds with the undead individual, gaining heightened awareness, memories, and instinctual battle reflexes.
     *Phantom Influence* - The undead individual can whisper advice, warnings, or knowledge directly into the living individual’s mind.
     *Legacy Surge* - When in a dire situation, the undead individual partially takes control to unleash its strongest abilities for a short time. However, prolonged use may cause identity erosion, making it unclear where the living individual ends and the undead individual begins.

4. Parasite Bond:
     *Life Drain* - The dominant individual can absorb energy, vitality, and magic from the submissive individual.
     *Shadow Leech* - The submissive individual can use the other’s abilities, but overuse risks backlash or losing control.
     *Flesh Alchemy* - Either individual can mutate parts of their bodies body temporarily, gaining monstrous traits.
     *Chains of Obligation* - The submissive individual must obey commands from the dominant individual (but may try to resist or betray).

5. Devoted Bond:
     *Shared Vitality* - Both individuals can heal the other by transferring life energy.
     *Empathic Surge* - An individual's emotions enhance the other's abilities (anger = strength, joy = agility, sorrow - durability).
     *Flame of Devotion* - Individuals can transfer places with each other.
     *Lasting Connection* - Both individuals can communicate telepathically to each other across distances.

There are members of each Connection in each type of Bond, but, as you can guess, some may be more common than others; individuals in more technologically-advanced civilisations are less inclined to form some Bonds than individuals in more primitive civilisations, as the circumstances are different in a less advanced civilisation.
