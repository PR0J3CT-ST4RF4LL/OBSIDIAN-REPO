Lord Kio's Pillar is one of the many pillars found floating above the surface of Etha. The pillar is commanded by one Lord Kio - for whom it is named after - who is one of the councilmembers of Roma. All who live on the pillar are subject to the laws and rulings of their lord, as they function as his labour force, and are paid a generous wage among other benefits such as free housing, healthcare, among other things. This labour force is split into 4 sections detailed below.

* Low Levels
     A

* Central Levels
     A

* Peripheral Levels
     A

* High Levels
     A

Among the main exports of the pillar are grains, precious gemstones and minerals, and other rarer resources exported from elsewhere on the planet. Most recently, Lord Kio has taken to selling artworks produced by a Voidwatcher known as Artifes, whom he bought at a black market auction held in a far-off land. Artifes is housed within the highest room in the High Levels so that she may get the best view of the landscapes from the balcony.
