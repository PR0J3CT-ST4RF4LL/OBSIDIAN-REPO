*A summary:*
Project Ad Astra is the name given to the being 'Ad Astra', created by Iteration = biomechanical researchers nearing the year [REDACTED]. It pertains to a biologically-incongruent being that contains a human's mind inside a metallic outer casing, which resembles a feminine humanoid form, albeit with major separations from human design. During the brief states of consciousness given to subject Astra, they have been recorded as saying that they are willing to work for **Eclipse**, as well as noting previously unknown facts about their body and biomechanical design.

*Physical appearance of Ad Astra:*
As stated previously, Astra is a feminine humanoid with a metal body. There is a large minigun mounted on Astra's left shoulder, which does not appear to impede movement in the slightest. Minigun has been previously modified to no longer need physical ammunition, but this alteration looks to be a later addition than the minigun itself. Astra has been compliant in showing off their percutaneous arsenal, and has revealed the items listed below (minigun included):

* Primary Systems:
     * Cyclone Cannon (SHOULDER)
         A rotary minigun mounted on the left shoulder capable of unleashing high-velocity, armour-piercing rounds. Utilizes electromagnetic acceleration to propel projectiles at incredible speeds, shown to be capable of cutting down enemy infantry or armoured vehicles with ease. This seems to be one of the first augmentations made to Astra, as it follows many  of the design philosophies of the subject's original design.
    
     * Grav-Pulse Emitters (PALMS)
         Located on Astra’s palms, these emitters harness gravitational fields to generate powerful shockwaves capable of repelling or crushing enemies. The repulsors can also create localized gravity wells to trap targets or disrupt vehicles, rendering them momentarily immobile. Seemingly another early addition to the Astra design.
    
     * Sky Reavers (BACK)
         A swarm of micro-missiles launched from a compact, back-mounted pod. This pod - or quiver - can be retracted into the back, allowing for seamless stealth-carry. These guided missiles operate under a swarm intelligence, allowing them to adapt to the battlefield and overcome countermeasures. Each missile can be equipped with multiple warheads, including concussive, EMP, or incendiary payloads. They can lock onto multiple targets at once, overwhelming enemy defences. A later addition to the Astra design. The appear to have been added at least several hundred years after [REDACTED], showing multiple awakening times, or one continuous conscious life.
    
     * Erebus Driver (CHEST)
         A chest-mounted railgun firing radioactive projectiles at hypersonic speeds. The depleted uranium slugs can penetrate the toughest armour, making it ideal for engaging heavily fortified targets. It includes gravitational stabilization for long-range accuracy, making it effective even against fast-moving targets. Another later addition, seemingly one of the latest added. Tech is high in calibre and craft, showing advancements in technology only seen in recent centuries.
    
     * Thermobaric Micro-Missiles (SHOULDERS)
         A shoulder-mounted system that fires small but devastating thermobaric missiles, which create pressure waves followed by firestorms through a two-stage detonation. Weapon has been shown to be perfect for clearing out enemy bunkers, vehicles, or large groups of foes. These seem to be a later addition as well, though most likely - from design features - fitted around the same time as the Sky Reavers. The left launcher is fitted under the minigun with more difficult placement, showing history of disassembly of that location and then reassembly after modification from original design.
    
     * Widow-Maker Cloud (BACK)
         A back-mounted pod capable of releasing
         nanites into the environment. These nanites can disrupt enemy equipment, disrupt vehicles, infiltrate technological systems, and even penetrate mechanical armour. Nanites will return to pod when signalled. One of the latest additions, though an earlier one that the Erebus Driver. Tests show that nanites are rendered obsolete when subjected to high-frequency electromagnetic waves, perhaps showing intended design flaws, or just shoddy craftsmanship.

* Secondary Systems:
     * Electro-Net Discharger (FOREARMS)
         This system releases a high-voltage, retractable electro-net, capable of disabling electronics, subduing enemies, and neutralizing mechanical threats. It can extend in a 10-meter long cone from the forearm. This addition seems to be from around the same time as the Sky Reavers.
    
     * Spectral Mirage Projector (CHEST)
         Astra uses a Spectral Mirage Projector, a cutting-edge piece of tech, to bend light and sound waves around Astra’s form, creating a true holographic distortion field. This field not only mimics Astra’s exact appearance but also projects multiple versions of themselves in different stances or actions. Astra has shown a capability to use this feature while restrained to appear outside of their restraints. This feature appears to be from the same addition timing as the Erebus Driver.
    
     * Refractive Energy Matrix (WRISTS)
         Astra utilizes a Refractive Energy Matrix, which manipulates energy fields around Astra’s exoskeleton to redirect incoming projectiles and blasts at near-perfect angles. The system creates a dynamic energy field that can absorb or deflect impacts, but unlike a standard shield, it works on a reactive, real-time basis by bending and diffusing energy across a spherical field. This also appears to have been added around the same time as the Erebus Driver and Spectral Mirage Projector.

* Tertiary Systems:
     * Vector Thrusters (SOLES)
         Astra is equipped with **compact ion thrusters** placed along their legs and feet, allowing for double-jumps and quick lateral movements. This makes them highly manoeuvrable in both air and on the ground, dodging enemy fire and repositioning with surgical precision. This addition seems to have been an original augmentation, like the Cyclone Cannon and Grav-Pulse Emitters.
    
     * Phase-Shift Module (SHOULDERS)
         A quantum phase-shifting technology embedded in Astra’s shoulders allows them to temporarily phase through solid objects. This ability would be perfect for bypassing walls, escaping tight situations, or evading high-damage attacks. This is another late addition, dated back to the addition of the Erebus Driver.
    
     * LIDAR and Thermal Vision (EYES)
         Astra has an integrated LIDAR scanner for real-time 3D mapping of the environment and thermal vision to detect heat signatures, even through walls. This grants Astra unparalleled situational awareness in both urban and battlefield environments. The thermal vision seems to have been added even before the Cyclone Cannon, making this the earliest addition found.
    
     * Acoustic Resonance Mapping (SKULL)
         Astra can use sonar-like feedback to detect movements and hidden threats through solid barriers, creating a map of any underground or concealed enemies. Though a small feature, it was only added around the time of the Erebus Driver, revealing flaws in the thought processes of the researchers who came before. Ad Astra is a product of human imagination, and so must obey its limits.
    
     * Quantum Echo Tracker (SKULL)
         An advanced tracking system capable of detecting quantum disturbances. This allows Astra to track teleporting or phased-shifted targets, ensuring nothing can escape their pursuit. In combat testing, this has proven to be increasingly fruitful in defeating even the strongest Superior Haze-Guards, with near-fatal damage being dealt perfectly on-target to incapacitate the tester. Needless to say, this is the latest addition yet, with Astra stating that it was added a few years after the Erebus Driver.
