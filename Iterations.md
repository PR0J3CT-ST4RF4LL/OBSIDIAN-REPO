The life of a plane of existence the size of a universe. They are ruled by up to 2 **Shatters**, and each Iteration has its own magic system and functionality. There are an unknown amount of Iterations. Iterations ‘reset’ their civilisations at the whim of their **Shatters**, at which point a catastrophic event will take place, sending all sentient, sapient species back to the beginning of basic civilisation. This is done to prevent an Iteration overthrowing their **Shatter**/**s** and removing knowledge of their existence from the public eye.
