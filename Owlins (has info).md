**Owlins:**

Owlins are not an uncommon appearance across Iterations, but they aren't a common one either. Dependent on the Iteration, one might only find one type of owlin inhabit an area. Owlins have approximately the same LE as humans or elves, dependent on the Iteration.

     * Subraces:
         Snowy Owlin:
         These owlins have a thick layer of densely-packed, white feathers to keep the cold out. They mostly inhabit cold forested areas, in which they build large and elaborate nests from fallen branches. They are a social creature, and tend to live in vast networks of these dwellings, occasionally spanning the entire forest.
    
         Desert Owlin:
         Contrasting to snowy owlins, desert owlins live in dry, arid areas, primarily alone in shallow caves. Their feathers have small holes on their ends, from which they dispense sweat that  has built up throughout the day. During the night, the feathers become matted, and cling close to the skin of the owlin, warming it.
    
         Adept Owlin:
         Adept owlins are the most capable of any of the owlin subraces. They possess a larger wingspan, as well as the ability to carry other creatures smaller than them. They are predominantly found in small amounts in other owlin civilisations, but groups of them have been found living separately in tall, coniferous woods.
    
         Feylike Owlin:
         The feylike owlins are not easy to fool. They are directly descended from the giant owls of which few remain now. They are the fastest flyers of any owlin and have eyes as keen as an eagle's. They fly so fast, that opponents will not even see them attack, before they fall to the ground, with an owlin flying off into the distance. They are the rarest of the owlins, and no one has successfully found a nest and lived to tell the tale.
