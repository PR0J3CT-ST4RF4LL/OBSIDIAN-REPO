**Etha:**
Iteration 1, also known by the denizens of their Iteration as **Etha**, is home to a very blatant magic, making certain igneous rocks formed from the remains of several super-volcanoes that formed across the Iteration's galaxy float into the air and hang, unaffected by gravity, approximately 5 miles above a planet's surface. These levitating pillars can be found planet-wide across most, if not all, planets in the Iteration. The local denizens of the pillars, majority elven, do not notice the oddness of this deviation in gravity. It is home to two **Shatters**, **Hexerei** and **Resplendence**.

Shortly after **K1**'s return to Iteration -1, the **Shatters** of Iteration 1 began fighting for an unknown reason. In their final conflict, **Insanity** was struck down, and supplanted by **Hexerei**.
