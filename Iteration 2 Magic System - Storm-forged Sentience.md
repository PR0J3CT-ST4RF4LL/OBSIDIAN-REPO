*Storm Spirits:*
Storm Spirits are awakened vestiges of Soul from previous denizens of Iteration 2 that died due to natural causes. While efforts have been made to replicate this through unnatural means, all results have been less than satisfactory and the experiments have been deemed unethical. A Storm Spirit appears to the human eye as a continuous drifting spark of low-voltage lightning. The electricity isn't a high enough voltage to kill, but it can cause low-level burns and insignificant damage to flora near it. Storm Spirits, while satiated, have been known to be helpful toward denizens of Iteration 2, and even more so toward their **Vengeful** and **Shades**.

To satiate a Storm Spirit, one must provide it with a stable source of electricity to draw from and feed off of. This has the additional biproduct of making the Storm Spirit grow in size, with the rough formula for growth being: *Growth of radius in mm / hour = ( kWh ) / current diameter of Storm Spirit*. This leads to logarithmic growth in Storm Spirit size over time. The average diameter of a newly-formed Storm Spirit is approximately 2cm in size.

*Usage of Storm Spirits:*
Storm Spirits are infused into the majority of major machinery used in Iteration 2, as they provide significant framerate increases as well as decreasing download or update time, among other things. They have been known to possess vestiges of their own autonomy after their death, and so are also used by the military in autonomous surveillance and policing, as well as in large cubes known as Storm Cubes, or (colloquially) 'Stormers'. Stormers come in a variety of sizes, and, dependent on the size, are befitted with a vast array of remotely-controlled machinery and drone software, with individual Storm Spirits that control the drones being merged back into the Stormer when not actively being used. The drones are most commonly equipped with heavy weaponry, such as machine guns and railguns, but the planetary governments have also been known to use large surveillance drones to scout out possible insurgency locations.

In addition to these incredibly helpful uses, Storm Spirits can form emotional ties to individuals near them, and will merge with technology that the individual uses commonly more willingly than others. It has been recorded commonly that Storm Spirits can be harnessed using mechanical devices which can be worn, increasing the wearer's abilities dependent on the location of the device (i.e. Gauntlets give increased strength, Boots give increased speed).

Should a Storm Spirit enter a machine which reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet, it will cause the weather within the region to become more volatile and prone to meteorological natural disasters and storms. Due to this, aside from in isolated testing facilities, Storm Spirits are disallowed from extended usage of these devices, despite the advantages of increased tele-communications and sonar ranges within the region.

Storm Spirits, while ostensibly useful in mechanical devices of various types, have also been known to be a good source of pain-relieving therapy while in a closely-monitored environment, with patients being recorded saying that it completely cured phantom pain from missing limbs, as well as increasing rate of tissue and cell repair. The longer-term advantages were discovered a short while later, with significant evidence of an increase in lifespan and a decreased chance of malignant cell mutation.

*Dangers of Storm Spirits:*
Due to their semi-limitless power and energy, Storm Spirits are perfect fits for the jobs they are given in their society, and are regularly kept happy. In incidents which have been recorded previously where Storm Spirits have been left undernourished, they will slowly decrease in size before exploding violently with the equivalent force of 50 tons of TNT. This both leads directly to the demise of the Storm Spirit while often causing mass outbreaks of forest fire, as well as disrupting local ecosystems for miles around due to the shockwave. Luckily for denizens of Iteration 2, Storm Spirits seem to actively move toward sources of electricity, no matter how far, and their speed increases at an exponential rate as they become more 'hungry'. Luckily, within the last day or so of being unfed, Storm Spirits will become sluggish and lethargic, and so no incidents have been recorded of a research site being entered into the blast radius of a Storm Spirit and then wiped out without warning.

In addition to this, throughout Iteration 2's expansive space travel campaigns, researchers and explorers alike have been shocked to find several examples of planets, habitable to biological life or not, covered with machinery. Further research is in active process of completion on the nature of these machine planets, with the current running theory being that the planets were once habitable, and were completely overrun with Storm Spirits - the evidence of this being an over-abundance of Storm Spirits on the surfaces of these planets, as well as volatile weather patterns and seemingly endless sources of power that evade location. From afar, in the void of space, these 'machine planets' have been known to be almost sentient-looking, with some researchers on one expedition remarking that the planet looked like a face, but this is currently being passed off as pareidolia. Evidence for the planets' sentience is growing, however, as some have been recorded as having extremely irregular orbits around their home stars, almost being pushed out of orbit by an invisible force that seems to originate from the planet itself.
