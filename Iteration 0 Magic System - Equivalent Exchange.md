**Iteration 0** gains its magic system from the **Shatter Rationality**. The magic system handles the innate ability to turn one substance into another, that being a change in state or in atomic configuration. A young transmutator might learn how to turn ice into water, water into water vapour, and/or vice-versa.

The limit on this power being that to transform an amount of something into an amount of something else, you must have equal value in the thing that you have as the amount of substance you want to create. Examples of this would be: Turning a large barrel of water into half a barrel of wine, turning a kilogram of lead into a kilogram of gold, or making 300 Bronze Tag (Iteration 0's currency) 's worth of gold into a gemstone worth 300 Bronze Tags.

The easier it would be to make a valuable item using a specific method, the harder it is to learn; it takes much less time to learn how to turn water into ice than it does to turn a cubic metre of water into a cubic centimetre of gold, and even more time to turn 300 Bronze Tag's worth of water into 300 Bronze Tag's worth of gold. The hardest method to learn being direct equivalent exchange, the ability to turn a specific amount (x) of a substance into (x) amount of another substance, such as the lead-to-gold example shown above.

It also puts more strain on the body and mind to change a substance innately rather than its state. Think about it, it's much easier to turn water into ice than it is to turn water into gold, as gold is a completely different element compared to hydrogen or oxygen.

Another thing of note, equivalent exchange only works on living beings under specific circumstances. Most **Shades** are able to perform it, but it requires a painstaking ritual involving **Rationality**'s express consent, though she usually overlooks this feature when her **Sword** or **Shield Shades** are the ones performing it.

As this power could theoretically create infinite riches, resources are tagged with a special stamp at their production site that is very hard to replicate using equivalent exchange - as it specialises in vague details - and therefore any material that does not have the stamp cannot be traded, bought, or used. In this way, the denizens nurture their power, but limit it, so as not to disrupt order. On a small side note, **Shades** are able to create this tag and thus bypass this, but **Shades** only can due to **Rationality**'s power, not through some finesse of their own.
