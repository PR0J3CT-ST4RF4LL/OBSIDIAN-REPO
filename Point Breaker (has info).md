*A summary:*
Project Point Break began shortly after the arrival of the Living Souls, where it was then found that the host planet of Iteration = had gained several unidentified natural satellites. These satellites were identified to be Objects 1-7 in accordance with the rarity they are spotted in. They take the appearance of the host planet's primary natural satellite, and are imperceptible outside of the planet's atmosphere. In the year I-7-1, a study was performed upon the denizens of the host planet, who had colloquially named each of these objects separately, according to the colour. The list proceeds as follows, in accordance to the numbering scheme previously stated:

Red Moon       - or 'Blood Moon'
Orange Moon - or 'Worker's Moon'
Yellow Moon  - or 'Celestial Moon'
Green Moon   - or 'Life Moon'
Blue Moon      - or 'Satiated Moon'
Indigo Moon  - or 'Demon Moon'
Violet Moon   - or 'Void Moon'

The according extremes of this spectrum of moon colour has been shown to directly impact the concentration of certain electromagnetic wavelengths, with more infrared waves being emitted upon the arrival of Object 1 and more ultraviolet waves being emitted upon the arrival of Object 7. As a side-note, testing has concluded that these satellites do not undergo traditional phases of brightness as a moon usually would, and are always shown upon appearance to be full. These objects - upon appearance - place themselves in the same orbit path of the first natural satellite of the planet, and blot the satellite from view. On rare occasion, Object 1 has been directly observed covering an illogical path which led to the discovery that Object 1 will always intrude in the event of a total solar eclipse. 8 of these events have happened thus far, with the next prediction of the eclipse being within the year I-9-1.
