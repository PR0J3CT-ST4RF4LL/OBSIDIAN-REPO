**Silvis:**

Iteration 2's main colonised planet is called '**Silvis**' by its populace. This civilisation, due to having advanced technological knowledge, has been the first to invent extra-planetary travel - measured by time from beginning of timeline. This is largely due to the fact that its two **Shatters**, **Autonomy** and **Consciousness**, have not the wish to restart their Iteration's progress nearly as much as the other **Shatters**. **Silvis** as a planet is partially covered in a thick, dense rainforest filled with colourful flora and many forms of varying fauna. Largely speaking, it has a higher density of advanced resources in its crust than most other Iterations.

**Silvis**' inhabitants have even been known to, on rare occasion, find old remnants of buildings from previous timelines that also achieved space travel. These buildings are used as scavenging sites for the less fortunate to gain favour and glory through finding some rare useful material in the colossal wreckages.
