**Warforged:**

Warforged are an exceedingly rare occurrence upon most Iterations, being found most commonly in **Anthravuil**, and even there they are a unique commodity. Warforged have little to no LE as most are created by denizens with little knowledge on **Shatters** or even **Vengeful**.

         Eternal Forge:
         A massive, hulking form comprised of various mechanical parts of unknown design. The warforged of the eternal forge seem to be a creation sent from the **Shatters** themselves, or even possibly a higher being. They are exceedingly rare, having little to no presence in the Iterations. No one knows where they live or call home. They are heavily resistant to attacks from **Shades** and **Vengeful**.
    
         Blazing Forge:
         A warforged of the blazing forge has a inset in their chest where sits a large, glowing fire set behind a metal grate. Warforged may blast this fire out of their bodies dealing grievous burns to those nearby. Their fire also grants them a torch-like ability to see through the dark close to them.
    
         Deathly Forge:
         Found rarely in astral elf cities in the **True Void**, these are warforged created for the sole purpose  of fighting. They exude deadly black gas from pores across their face-plate and torso, as well as extremities. They can shoot this gas at opponents much like the blazing forge does with its fire. Not much is known of warforged of the deathly forge, even among **Shatters**.
