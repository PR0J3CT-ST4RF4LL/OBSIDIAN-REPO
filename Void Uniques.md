Void Uniques are separated into two categories, and then further with each category being separated into two sub-categories.

* Armour:
     Pre-Singularity:
     Pre-Singularity armour is the base form of Void Armour found in the True Void. Ill-fitting, it shines a dim white light in low light and darkness. It takes the form of full-body plate, defying all reason through a lack of straps and connections between pieces. This grants high defensive capabilities, but with weak spots that lead directly through the armour. 

     Post-Singularity:
     Post-Singularity Void Armour is the best armour anyone could wish for. Full-body impenetrable plate protection making the wearer virtually invincible. It can un-form and reform from the air at the will of the user. The armour perfectly fits the user, no matter the size, sacrificing no defences for movement, and yet the wearer can move as fluidly as the passing breeze.
* Weaponry:
     Pre-Singularity:
     A somehow shoddily-crafted sword, despite its pristine nature. It may cleave opponents, but with none of the grace of a truly well-crafted blade. It glows dimly in the darkness.

     Post-Singularity:
     The perfect weapon. It will slash through even the toughest of materials, able to un-form and reform from the air at the will of the user. It can even change forms to suit the wielder's taste - for  example, a sword to spear.

Known locations:
* Armour:
     One Post-Singularity set in the possession of **K1**, currently in **Iteration 0** after the collision with the other Iterations, causing the creation of **Echo**.

     One Pre-Singularity set in the possession of a **Vengeful** of **K1**, currently in the **True Void**

     All other sets are in unknown locations spread across the **True Void**.
* Weaponry:
     One Post-Singularity set in the possession of **K1**, currently in **Iteration 0** after the collision with the other Iterations, causing the creation of **Echo**.

     One Post-Singularity set in the possession of a **Vengeful** of **K1**, currently in the **True Void**.

     One Post-Singularity set in the possession of a denizen of **The Stickworld**, currently in an unknown location after the banishment of a **Shade** of **K1**.

     All other sets are in unknown locations spread across the **True Void**.

* Shards Of Broken Form:
     The Shards Of Broken Form are a collection of weapons rarely found within the True Void that are known to have incredible power. They all possess extreme intelligence and wisdom, a natural result of their timeless lifespan, and have powers innately spectacular to any who see them - even **Shatters**. They are crafted from splinters of the **Shattered One**, and so have the same power as a **Shatter**. Some Shards perform their abilities upon a single hit, however small, and some need to kill their target for the effects to begin. The Shards of each type will be listed at the bottom of the section.
    
     1. Time Paradox:
         Time Paradox is a weapon capable of reverting a being's existence back to before they existed. In layman's terms, it destroys you and whatever you influenced. Obviously if this was used on a **Shatter**, their entire Iteration would vanish. Although **K1** has briefly conversed with me about Time Paradox, they refused to tell me the location, only referring to it as "Deep nothingness". Clearly, this is a rational thought process.
    
     2. Chronophobia:
         Chronophobia is the alternate version of Time Paradox, and vice-versa. Instead of deleting anything the victim influenced, Chronophobia spreads the knowledge of the victim thinly among every other living being in existence, and then destroys the victim's mind. This leaves you with a controllable husk, and a very slightly smarter populace. The knowledge is rarely enough to be detectable, however, so it effectively still kills the victim.
    
    3. Shattered Ashes:
         This blade does half the work that Chronophobia does, as it must be combined with Conclusion to become either Time Paradox, or the aforementioned Chronophobia. Shattered Ashes does not kill its victim, but follows Chronophobia by wiping their mind of knowledge and turning them into a husk. It does not, however, spread the victim's knowledge among living beings; it just destroys it.
    
    4. Conclusion:
         This blade does half the work that Time Paradox does, as it must be combined with Shattered Ashes to become either Conclusion, or the aforementioned Time Paradox. Conclusion cannot kill a victim, instead, it reverts the victim back to the beginning of its life, in this instance meaning conception. As a fertilised egg cannot survive and grow into a foetus outside a womb, the victim dies swiftly after. Upon the victim's death, Conclusion influences the minds of any creature that knew the victim, and persuades them of a reasonable answer to why the victim is 'no longer around', such as "Oh, they went on holiday and we haven't heard from them since. They didn't tell us when they'd come back.".
    
    5. The Broken Blade Of Dusk:
         This blade is different. While other Shards may be simple swords with special effects, this blade knows you. And while it may fool you with its 'broken' appearance, if one were to attune to the weapon, they would find the secrets of this weapon revealed. Such a power is this that the blade's power is locked away without this sacrilegious ritual. 
    
    6. Dusk's Epitaph:
         The Broken Blade Of Dusk's secrets are opened to the user. A soul-gatherer of a weapon. A long, black blade with embedded amber crystals imbued with rites foul to the eyes of most anyone who views them. This weapon was created for the sole purpose of collecting the pure energy of its victims, subjecting them to the full fury of nothingness as it collects their soul, storing it in the amber. For each soul collected, the amber grows brighter and brighter. The more energy a soul has, the more light the amber will gain upon the victim's unforgivable murder with this blade. The user can even, should they be foolish enough to even use the blade, expend the energy of the souls imbued in the amber to kill things more effectively and easily.
