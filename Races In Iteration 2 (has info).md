**Races that inhabit Silvis:**

**Humans:**

Humans are known to populate a vast majority of Iterations across time and space. They possess quite a basic understanding of the world around them and have relatively low average LE scores.

On **Silvis**, humans are actually - surprisingly - less common than the elves. Humans work the same occupations as elves, however, because the occupants of **Iteration 2** are 'too kindly in nature to harbour racism or speciesism' as one **Shade** of **Autonomy** put it.

**Elves:**

Elves are sparser in population density and the amount of Iterations they inhabit compared to humanity. They are more likely to be chosen as **Vengeful** or **Shades** and possess a generally higher average LE compared to humanity. Most elves have some brief and basic understanding of **Vengeful** and **Shades**, despite a majority not being aware of the **Shatters**, instead opting to worship false gods created to fill gaps in knowledge.

Elves on **Silvis** largely worship their 'machine god' or 'Duominius Mechaenicai', as their interpretation as the source of their power. This is largely due to a miscommunication when a **Shade** visited the elves under the guise of 'lightning incarnate', to put it in the witness' terms. They mistook this to be a messenger from the machines themselves, and thus devoted themselves to the machines in turn. Sadly, that miscommunication caused the creation of the largest religion in the Iteration.

**Warforged:**

Warforged are an exceedingly rare occurrence upon most Iterations, being found most commonly in **Anthravuil**, and even there they are a unique commodity. Warforged have little to no LE as most are created by denizens with little knowledge on **Shatters** or even **Vengeful**.

The amount of warforged on **Silvis** could be counted on a human's hands. Sadly, their actual recorded amount is not known, but the amount of differing ones that have been sighted is anywhere from five to seven. This is due largely to the fact that on **Silvis**, warforged were only an import from **Anthravuil**, and were largely left to decay from their measly starting number of twenty imported. Remains of warforged, in the current timeline of **Iteration 2**, are being studied by experts, human and elf alike.
