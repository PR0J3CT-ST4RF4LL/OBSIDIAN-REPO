Iteration = is a modified world, not bound by the requirements of most **Shatters**. The Eclipse Project denies the existence of **Shatters** other than the **Eclipse**, which visits once a decade. The planet has been thoroughly transformed from what was once a thriving metropolis to a decadent maze of interconnecting factories. The races of this Iteration live primarily in hovel-like towers stretching far into the sky, nearly to the edge of the atmosphere. The factories aren't far behind, as the planets become harvested of all natural - and unnatural - resources and transformed from raw materials into useful products. Everything from a blade to a metal sheet to rocket engine can be found and bought in some dark alley overgrown with industrial egotism. 

Iteration = gets its incredible manufacturing power from the theft of other Iteration's denizens. You can find humans from Iteration 0 working on piping next to hulking warforged from Iteration 2, creating an odd amalgamation of culture - increasing the spread of fear among the populace. The method of induction for new 'members' is not known, but careful experimentation has led to the belief that when a denizen gains too much LE, they have a chance of being 'picked'. This chance can be lessened by the **Shatter** of the Iteration the denizen belongs to putting the denizen in their keeping (in a position such as a **Vengeful** or **Shade**) though this has been proven false by spies - from Iterations other than = - keeping watch on ex-**Vengeful** inside of the factories and reporting that they gain some sort of new power upon their transportation to Iteration =.

The 'government' of Iteration = - or the closest connection the populace have to **Eclipse** - are known as 'the Ministry', though any Ministry member would tell you that it's "Actually known as the Administration Services of the Public of Iteration =", but any Ministry member also would've already shoved the barrel of a poorly-crafted railgun against your head and order you back to work. The Ministry is responsible for the housing, clothing, and feeding of the general population - a matter which they take quite seriously, by which I mean they deny any request for reasonable rights at the first mention - and so you'd find dissenters mysteriously 'disappeared' one break-time when they 'went for a walk outside'.
