The Eclipse Project is one of the many protocols run by the sinister **Eclipse**. Though little is known about the projects in general, most knowledge is congealed around this specific project, which was started in conjunction with the first arrivals of Living Souls. The project is centred around the collection of Soul to produce artificial life-forms that possess a smidge of Soul each. The project is currently on track to be complete by the Finale at the end of the first campaign.

**Eclipse** plans to release the 'Soullikes' in the form of Helldivers, whose memories and preferences were gathered from Soul from the Living Soul 'Gray'. In addition to this, they plan to gather more Soul from others before the Finale in order to create more Soullikes of the Living Souls' operations within other video-games. Soul will be used to create objects and inanimate creations from these video-games to use as transports, weapons, and more.
