**Races that inhabit Anthravuil:**

**Humans:**

Humans are known to populate a vast majority of Iterations across time and space. They possess quite a basic understanding of the world around them and have relatively low average LE scores.

Humans in **Anthravuil** were known for their enhanced technological advancements, embracing steam power and all mechanisms movement-based. A large percentage of even the common people in **Aranduale**, the capital city of the kingdom of **Aresian**, have a keen understanding of complex inner workings of machinery they have only had the materials and knowledge to construct in the last decade of its current running timeline.

**Elves:**

Elves are sparser in population density and the amount of Iterations they inhabit compared to humanity. They are more likely to be chosen as **Vengeful** or **Shades** and possess a generally higher average LE compared to humanity. Most elves have some brief and basic understanding of **Vengeful** and **Shades**, despite a majority not being aware of the **Shatters**, instead opting to worship false gods created to fill gaps in knowledge.

Elves in **Anthravuil** were known to pioneer the creation of the steam engine during the current progress of the Iteration and have been known to do so on the majority of times that the Iteration has progressed to that point. At the point of the current running timeline, a majority of elves work occupations relative to steam power, such as worker’s guilds and even lower-level menial jobs such as steam-monitoring.

**Warforged:**

Warforged are an exceedingly rare occurrence upon most Iterations, being found most commonly in **Anthravuil**, and even there they are a unique commodity. Warforged have little to no LE as most are created by denizens with little knowledge on **Shatters** or even **Vengeful**.

Warforged in **Anthravuil** were an accidental incident of a creation functioning off of steam power gaining sapience. In the past, yet still during **Iteration 0**’s current timeline, Warforged were known as a rare item to be traded and bought much like glorified objects and statues. As they were created in the image of **‘god machines’**, warforged possess a greater understanding of steam power than even most humans and even some elves, as their biology solely consists of a steam engine that must be kept running lest the warforged die from lack of power. Sadly, due to most other sapient life denying the existence of warforged knowledge, they are usually put to work in menial tasks and entry-level occupations as simple, unthinking machines.

**Changelings:**

Changelings, while a rarer occurrence than elves or humans in Iterations, are known to be the most common race chosen to be **Shades** or **Vengeful**, as their transformative abilities allow them to outwit **Shades** and **Vengeful** from other Iterations. Their LE is quite high compared to most other races; they are commonly known to perform occult rituals directly to the **Shatters** that rule their Iteration.

Not much is known of changelings in **Anthravuil**, as they are commonly in differing guises. This is due to the native changeling’s population on **Iteration 0** having horrific and distended base forms that do not age, but tire of transformation the more transforming a changeling does. It is estimated that every two transformations an **Anthravian** changeling undergoes counts as roughly a third of a year compared to the average lifespan of a human.
