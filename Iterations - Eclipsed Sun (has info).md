War has begun, though nobody knows it yet. In secret, K1 - Shatter of Iteration -1 - has been amassing an army to challenge the tyrannical rule of Eclipse, Shatter of Iteration =. K1 has done this through the employment of powerful souls, gifted to them by the True One. These souls were made to possess bodies across the Iterations in order to prepare against a yet-dormant threat. The threat has now awoken upon the first resetting of Iteration -1, and the sinister Eclipse Project has been set in motion.

The souls begin have begun to advance, growing and living their lives, dying and being reborn. Some yearn for power, some yearn just to be. All will be subjugated should the Eclipse Project succeed. K1 is preoccupied by a deviant soul, and is accosted by a vassal of Eclipse, who begins to infect the land. Resets occur, time passes, and the infection has grown. K1, with the assistance of the deviant soul, vanquishes the false god. This partially infects K1, causing their soul to strain. This causes a timeline error, which opens Iteration -1 back to the True Void. The resulting wave of energy sent K1 and the other Iterations back in time. An Echo of K1 is put in K1's place, as K1 is now amnesic in Iteration 0. The real war has begun.

The souls now travel the newly-opened Iterations, growing in power. One manages to supplant a Shatter, and - after bringing K1 back to Iteration -1 - a newer soul is made their Sword-Shade, that being the first twice-Shade. Disruptions are caused by the deviant soul's reckless opening of a portal to another realm. K1 holds a feast in which they announce the arrival of Vee, a mysterious figure of no discernible origin. K1 proclaims that the end is nigh, and that all the Shades should spread the word. The twice-Shade is denied a Shard Of Broken Form. The souls begin to ready themselves for the final fight.
