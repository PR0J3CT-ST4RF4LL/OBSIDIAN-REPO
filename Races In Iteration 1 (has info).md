**Humans:**

Humans are known to populate a vast majority of Iterations across time and space. They possess quite a basic understanding of the world around them and have relatively low average LE scores.

**Elves:**

Elves are sparser in population density and the amount of Iterations they inhabit compared to humanity. They are more likely to be chosen as **Vengeful** or **Shades** and possess a generally higher average LE compared to humanity. Most elves have some brief and basic understanding of **Vengeful** and **Shades**, despite a majority not being aware of the **Shatters**, instead opting to worship false gods created to fill gaps in knowledge.

**Changelings:**

Changelings, while a rarer occurrence than elves or humans in Iterations, are known to be the most common race chosen to be **Shades** or **Vengeful**, as their transformative abilities allow them to outwit **Shades** and **Vengeful** from other Iterations. Their LE is quite high compared to most other races; they are commonly known to perform occult rituals directly to the **Shatters** that rule their Iteration.
