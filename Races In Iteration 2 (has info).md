**Races that inhabit Silvis:**

[[Humans (has info)]]

On **Silvis**, humans are actually - surprisingly - less common than the elves. Humans work the same occupations as elves, however, because the occupants of **Iteration 2** are 'too kindly in nature to harbour racism or speciesism' as one **Shade** of **Autonomy** put it.

[[Elves (has info)]]

Elves on **Silvis** largely worship their 'machine god' or 'Duominius Mechaenicai', as their interpretation as the source of their power. This is largely due to a miscommunication when a **Shade** visited the elves under the guise of 'lightning incarnate', to put it in the witness' terms. They mistook this to be a messenger from the machines themselves, and thus devoted themselves to the machines in turn. Sadly, that miscommunication caused the creation of the largest religion in the Iteration.

[[Warforged (has info)]]

The amount of warforged on **Silvis** could be counted on a human's hands. Sadly, their actual recorded amount is not known, but the amount of differing ones that have been sighted is anywhere from five to seven. This is due largely to the fact that on **Silvis**, warforged were only an import from **Anthravuil**, and were largely left to decay from their measly starting number of twenty imported. Remains of warforged, in the current timeline of **Iteration 2**, are being studied by experts, human and elf alike.
