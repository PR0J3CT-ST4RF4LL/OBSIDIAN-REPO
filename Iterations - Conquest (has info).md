It has been millennia since the fall of The Eclipse Project, but the stories of grandeur from that day have not passed into obscurity. Some stories, however, are new. Echoes from days long past of mythical armaments called the Shards Of Broken Form have once again come to light, and they whisper throughout the Iterations like ghosts.

Three Shards in particular are the most sought-after, as these were known to be present at the end of the Eclipse Project. They are:

Warshaper

Wildshaper

Willshaper

These weapons have defensive counterparts, summoned alongside them:

Warbreaker

Wildbreaker

Willbreaker

As the tales cross the Iterations, ties form, and three distinct groups across the Iterations are formed, ech in search of a specific Shard. These groups are:

The Children Of The Forge
Who search for Warshaper and Warbreaker.

The Children Of The Wind
Who search for Wildshaper and Wildbreaker.

The Children Of The Dust
Who search for Willshaper and Willbreaker.

Each group is present in every Iteration save Iteration -1 and Iteration =. This is because both have been blocked from the True Void by an unknown force. Some still claim - in backwater towns across the Iterations - to see a tall, blond figure wearing an inhuman skeletal mask and clad in dark, arcane armour that shines like the stars in the night. These tales are mostly disregarded, however, and few know the truth. The souls have passed from their previous hosts, yet still can loosely control their previous bodies. The new bodies are spread far across the Iterations once more, and in search of new rewards from life.

The groups wish only to acquire the Shards they lay claim to, and to deny the other groups their Shards. They are secretive and territorial in nature, using loaned Vengeful and Shades from a man known only as Vee to transfer messages between the Iterations. In exchange, each of the groups have been ordered not to let any Shatter possess the Shards, as that could spell doom for all. Each group knows that Vee is playing all sides, and all resent Vee secretly for their slyness. 

Each player in this does not know any other player's group alignment, or the Iteration they're in.
