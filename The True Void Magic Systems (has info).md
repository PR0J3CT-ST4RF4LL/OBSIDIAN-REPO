The True Void is home to a variety of separate magic systems, from volatile Soul magic to the ominous Shards Of Broken Form. Some systems interact with the environment, while others are a bit more... hostile. One can learn all from just one Height Of Magic, so Keepers are required to be very cautious in their wanton handing-out of these powerful resources.

As it is the most powerful and power-intensive by nature, the True Void's magic systems are usually regarded as the most powerful across the Iterations. As such, I - **Vee** - have spread them across the True Void, each in large pockets that, due to the nature of the True Void, swirl around. I have counteracted this by placing them at separate layers, each layer home to a separate magic system. Denizens can only learn the magic system of the region they are from, so they cannot become overly powerful. As well as this, Heights Of Magic are nearly impossible for denizens, or even most Vengeful, to get a hold of (save the exceptions being the Living Souls), so I have no need to worry about that.

Little is known about the magic systems themselves (I haven't presented the opportunity to learn about them to others yet) but the little they do know could be dangerous information if given into the wrong hands. Should the Iad get their hands on this using Heights Of Magic given by **Eclipse**, it may spell the end for even - possibly - several Living Souls.
