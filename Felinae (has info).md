**Felinae:**

Felinae are much the same as Owlins, where they may appear as only one form across an Iteration. They possess a cat-like appearance, much like larger felines but for several exceptions, including bipedal nature and sapience, as well as the ability to speak the common tongue of an Iteration on most occasions. Their LE is about the same as a human's.
