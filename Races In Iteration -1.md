**Races that inhabit The Stickworld:**

**Void-Figures:**

A name for the sole denizens of Iteration -1. Void-Figures are not known to populate any Iterations outside of their original Iteration. Oddly, they are able to travel between Iterations via the **True Void** due to the closeness between **K1**, their **Shatter**, and **The True One**. Void-Figures are unable to enter water due to being comprised of an ink-like substance that dissipates when interacting with liquids, and as such they carry a general disdain for it. Void-Figures do not seem to require food, sleep, or aforementioned water as they do not possess natural souls, instead being those of the deceased across other Iterations. As they are usually formed from the dead souls of other Iterations, most other denizens have a general disdain and/or fear of Void-Figures.
They have been known to have extraordinarily high LE, exceeding that of even Changelings at points, and can even harbour living souls from the mortal plane as their hosts.
