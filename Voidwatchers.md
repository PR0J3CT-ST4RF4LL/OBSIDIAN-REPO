*Description:*
The eyes and ears of **Truth**. Usually reserved for plot-relevant non-'Living Soul'-player-characters, this group of highly important individuals consists of Truth's own secret police. They are primarily consisted of highly-powerful beings, often with powers that could rival some abilities of those with Void Uniques.

Voidwatchers can be most commonly - and yet still rarely - found in iterations with high levels of technology or arcane energy. They usually all share several common traits, but these traits may not be true to an absolute - exceptions have been noted. The common traits are usually: white hair, blue eyes, small stature (or eternal adolescent appearance), and a *power* from Earth before The End. All Voidwatchers are guaranteed to not be your regular individual, however, as even if they don't possess a *power*, there is consistency in that something will always set them apart from others.

Living Souls possess an affinity for detecting Voidwatchers, as a Voidwatcher soul is bright enough for even them to see - being a slice of **Truth** in and of itself. Voidwatchers do not actively seek out Living Souls, but their paths may coincide with Living Souls with certain coincidences.
