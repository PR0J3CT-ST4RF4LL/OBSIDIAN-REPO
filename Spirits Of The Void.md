There are special powers given to those who possess both a Void Unique Weapon and Armour. These powers are chosen through a selection of flasks holding alcoholic beverages presented to the holder directly by the **True One**. The beverage is not passed through the body and is absorbed into the blood, where it travels to and rests in the heart. The more of these flasks the holder has drunk from, and the longer it has been since they drank from one, the more intensive the resulting power backlash will become every time they use their powers.

The list goes as follows:
1. Storm:
     Power 1: Thunderstride:
     The user's speed is fuelled by bursts of electrical energy. Each time they dash, they leave an electrified trail that lingers briefly, damaging or stunning enemies who touch it. Their movement is accompanied by the sound of rolling thunder, disorienting foes within a certain radius. The more sustained the movement, the louder the "thunderclap" at the end, potentially knocking back enemies.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Tempest's Wrath:
     Small storm clouds trail behind the user, enhanced by their emotional state. If the user is calm, foes may only experience static shocks and drizzle. If the user is angry, the rain is thunderous, with lightning striking down on enemies occasionally. If the user is fearful, the rain ceases, replaced by a cold, wet air, filled with mist. Lightning strikes frequently, hitting friends and foes alike.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Arcbolt Surge:
     The user stores kinetic energy as they move, and after reaching a certain threshold (such as after a long sprint), they can release a focused bolt of lightning at a target or in a line, dealing heavy damage and potentially paralyzing enemies.
2. Wind:
     Power 1: Gale Glide:
     When the user is heavily injured, their body instinctively lightens, and swirling gusts surround them, allowing brief bursts of flight or hovering. These winds also push enemies back, giving the character breathing room. The stronger the injury, the longer the flight lasts, with gusts of wind occasionally deflecting projectiles mid-air. In addition, every landing creates a "shockwave gust" that knocks enemies prone or disrupts their footing.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Feather Form:
     The user’s lighter-than-usual body allows them to leap incredible distances and maintain incredible speed. This ability also reduces fall damage to zero, as they can "catch" themselves with wind currents. When dodging or weaving through attacks, the user creates slashing wind currents in their wake. These currents deal minor damage to enemies or disrupt incoming attacks (arrows are deflected, spells are destabilized).
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Razor Wind:
     By channelling their lightness into a focused strike, the user generates a cutting wind that sweeps in an arc or a straight line. This attack is enhanced if the user is airborne, gaining both range and damage.
3. Fire:
     Power 1: Ember Trail:
     Flames ignite along the ground wherever the user moves, lingering for a short time and creating a burning hazard for enemies. They can shape the trail into controlled bursts or waves of fire by kicking, directing them at enemies or creating fiery barriers. If the user is standing still, the flames swirl around them, forming a defensive ring that damages anyone who gets too close.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Infernal Resilience:
     When the user takes damage, their body instinctively bursts into flames, reducing the damage they receive and dealing fire damage to nearby enemies. The flames also grant temporary immunity to debuffs like poison or freezing effects. The user can absorb fire from the environment (including enemy fire attacks) to heal themselves or empower their Ember Trail. This makes them a walking conduit of flame, thriving in fiery chaos.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Pyrokinetic Mastery:
     The user can manipulate nearby flames (including their Ember Trail) to morph around their Void Unique Weapon like fiery spears or shields, for a brief duration.
4. Water:
     Power 1: Aquatic Surge:
     The user can summon bursts of water to propel themselves forward with immense speed, whether on land or in water. This movement can disorient enemies caught in the surge and allow for quick repositioning. As they move, they leave behind slick water trails that trip or slow enemies, creating a tactical advantage. If used offensively, the surge can form a concentrated water strike, dealing concussive damage to a single target.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Fluid Barrier:
     The user can create a swirling barrier of water around themselves or an ally. The barrier deflects projectiles, absorbs impacts, and extinguishes fire-based attacks. While the barrier is active, the user can redirect the water into a focused blast, knocking enemies back or drowning out sound to create confusion in combat.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Tidal Grasp:
     The user summons tendrils of water from the ground or nearby sources, which lash out to grab or push enemies. The tendrils are strong enough to pin smaller foes or knock larger ones off balance. If the user concentrates, the tendrils can form into a single massive wave that crashes into enemies, scattering them and leaving the ground saturated to enhance subsequent water-based moves.
5. Earth:
     Power 1: Seismic Snare:
     The user can summon cracks in the ground with a stomp or gesture, targeting specific areas. The cracks erupt suddenly, creating fissures that trap enemies' legs or swallow them up to their waists, immobilizing them. The user can control how the fissures close. For example, they could seal the cracks partially to crush enemies’ legs or fully trap them underground (non-lethal in some cases, depending on combat needs). This ability can also disrupt the terrain, making it harder for enemies to manoeuvre.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Stone Veil:
     When heavily injured, the user instinctively melts into the earth, traveling underground in a straight line or in a zigzag pattern. This allows them to avoid further damage and emerge at a safe distance or behind their enemies. While underground, they can sense vibrations in the ground, effectively "seeing" everything within a radius. This could also allow for ambushes, with the user erupting from the earth to knock enemies off balance or create shockwaves.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Earthen Aegis:
     When injured, the user summons protective stone plates that form a temporary, movable shield around their body. The shield absorbs damage but can also be hurled at enemies in fragments, dealing concussive damage before reforming. These stone plates are drawn from the ground, leaving indentations that can act as traps or obstacles for enemies.
6. Void:
     Power 1: Pocket Void:
     The user can create small void-like portals that act as temporary, portable dimensions. These can serve multiple purposes depending on the situation:
     * Utility: Store or conceal objects, allies, or even themselves for a short time, making them untouchable but unable to act.
     * Combat: Trap enemies in the void momentarily, disorienting them with the crushing emptiness inside and returning them to the battlefield weakened or stunned.
     The voids are connected to each other, allowing the user to create a network of portals for rapid movement across the battlefield or to launch attacks through the void. For example, they could throw a weapon into one void and have it emerge from another.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Abyssal Shroud:
     The user emanates an oppressive darkness that not only damages enemies but also affects their senses. The shroud will:
     * Blind enemies: Reducing their accuracy or rendering them unable to perceive allies.
     * Sap vitality: Weakening enemies over time as the void consumes their life force.
     * Enhance allies: Within the aura, the user and their allies are cloaked, granting them partial invisibility or resistance to ranged attacks.
     The shroud pulsates and whispers with fragments of the void’s essence, unnerving enemies and instilling fear, forcing them to flee.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Void Pulse:
     The user can release a pulse of void energy that momentarily warps reality around them. This will:
     * Knock enemies back as though gravity reversed for an instant.
     * Distort space, slowing down enemies’ movements or projectiles as they pass through the affected area.
     * Inflict Void Corrosion, a lingering effect that causes disorientation and minor damage over time.
7. Ice:
     Power 1: Frostforge:
     The user can create weapons or constructs made entirely of ice, summoning them instantly from thin air. These creations are razor-sharp and can be wielded directly or launched at enemies. The ice constructs are incredibly resilient, shattering only after prolonged use or heavy impact. When destroyed, they explode into a burst of sharp shards, damaging nearby enemies. The user can trap enemies with these creations, forming icy chains or spikes that emerge from the ground to pin targets in place.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Permafrost Aura:
     The user radiates an aura of intense cold, causing the ground around them to freeze solid. This aura slows enemies, reduces their physical strength, and makes the terrain hazardous, with jagged ice forming beneath their feet. Allies within the aura become invigorated by the chill, gaining resistance to fire or heat-based attacks and increased endurance. The air within the aura sparkles with icy motes, and frost spreads across surfaces in real time, creating an oppressive, wintry battlefield.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Glacial Spike:
     The user summons massive ice spikes from the ground to impale or block enemies. These spikes grow rapidly in size and can break apart into smaller, jagged pieces, causing area damage. The spikes remain for a short time, acting as barriers or hazards that funnel enemy movement or provide cover for the user.
8. Ash:
     Power 1: Ebon Drift:
     The user generates a swirling cloud of ash that follows them or spreads across the battlefield. This ash obscures vision, making it harder for enemies to aim or detect movements. The ash clings to enemies, slowing them down and sapping their stamina as though the weight of the past is pressing down on them. For allies, the ash provides concealment, making them harder to target.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Cindershroud: 
     The user's body transforms into a semi-corporeal state of drifting ash when they are injured or in danger. In this form, physical attacks pass through them, and they can reform a short distance away, leaving a choking trail of ash in their wake. The ash trail left behind acts like a trap, choking or blinding enemies who pass through it. While in this form, the user’s movements become slower but deliberate, as though they're dissolving and reforming with every step.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Ashen Grasp:
     The user summons tendrils of ash that rise from the ground to bind or crush enemies. These tendrils spread like smoke, enveloping enemies and making it harder for them to escape. If the tendrils succeed in immobilizing a foe, they leave a lingering layer of ash that weakens the enemy’s attacks, representing their strength crumbling to dust.
9. Nature:
     Power 1: Verdant Bloom:
     The user can summon a rapid, explosive growth of plants around them, from flowers to vines. These plants don’t need soil to grow—they spring up anywhere, using ambient energy and air to thrive. These plants can bind or entangle enemies, create walls of thorny brambles for defence, or be used as a launching pad for quick movement (like springing off vines to leap across the battlefield). The user can control the nature of the plants - roses that emit paralyzing pheromones, vines that crush enemies, or blossoms that heal allies when touched. The plants have a faint glow or mystical aura, adding to their supernatural vitality.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Spore Storm:
     The user can release a cloud of spores into the air, which descend upon enemies and the environment. These spores have various effects, such as:
     * Hallucination spores that confuse enemies, causing them to see illusions or make erratic movements.
     * Toxic spores that weaken enemies over time, dealing damage or reducing their combat effectiveness.
     * Growth spores that cause plants to rapidly bloom, forming entangling vines or creating barriers to block attacks.
     The spores linger for a short time, and the user can control the spread, making it difficult for enemies to escape. The user can also absorb spores into their body for health regeneration and a temporary boost in power.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Restoration Wave: 
     The user can release a pulse of natural energy that heals allies or purges negative conditions. This energy is drawn from the surrounding flora and fauna, revitalizing those within range. This ability  also has the secondary effect of damaging or weakening enemies who have disrupted nature, causing them to lose vitality as the natural world fights back against them.
10. Lava:
     Power 1: Magma Flow:
     The user can manipulate molten magma as a fluid, not bound to the ground. They can shape it into projectiles or form it into temporary barriers. When thrown, it forms into molten spheres that deal burning damage on contact but dissipate after a short period. The magma can be controlled with precision, creating flowing paths of molten rock that trail behind them, burning enemies who get too close. The user can also use it to momentarily melt through barriers or obstruct pathways by creating a wall of molten rock. 
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Lava Cocoon: 
     The user can encase themselves (or an ally) in a shell of hardened magma, transforming it into a temporary shield. This cocoon absorbs damage, but when it is broken or the duration ends, it erupts with a burst of molten energy, dealing damage to surrounding enemies. The user can command the lava to solidify or liquefy depending on the situation - solid for defence and form, liquid for mobility or attacking. When the cocoon erupts, the lava can temporarily blind enemies or leave lingering molten residue that damages enemies over time.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Eruption Pulse:
     The user releases a shockwave of molten energy from their body, causing the ground beneath them to rupture and release a pulse of lava in all directions. This attack leaves scorch marks, and the lava can be used to block enemy movements or deal significant area damage. The pulse causes temporary lava geysers to erupt randomly, creating additional hazards for enemies as they try to navigate the battlefield.
11. Electricity:
     Power 1: Arc Conduit:
     The user can create and control streams of unnatural electricity, channelling it through objects they touch or summon from their body. This electricity can arc to nearby metal objects, generating powerful electrical discharges that damage or disable anything in its path. The user can use conductive materials like wires, metal beams, or even their own Void Unique Weapon to form a circuit, making the electricity more targeted and efficient. They can also overload objects with electricity, causing them to explode or malfunction.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Static Surge:
     The user can unleash a burst of charged static electricity, creating an electrical pulse that pulses out in all directions. This pulse stuns enemies, causes minor burns, and disrupts technological devices nearby. The pulse also causes the user to temporarily become electrically charged themselves, allowing them to deal lightning damage when making physical contact with enemies. The static burst leaves behind an aftereffect, where the surrounding area crackles with lingering electrical energy for a few seconds, possibly sparking small fires or zapping enemies if they get too close.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Electromagnetic Field:
     The user can generate a field of electromagnetic energy that disrupts electrical devices, interferes with enemy electronics, and creates a repulsive force against metallic objects or enemies. This field can provide a defensive mechanism by deflecting or slowing down ranged attacks, such as bullets or projectiles, or it could be used offensively to manipulate or control metal objects, bending them, or even launching them as weapons.
12. Karma:
     Power 1: Moral Reflection:
     The user can reflect the emotional or moral energy of a target, altering the effects based on the target’s actions or intentions. For example:
     * For good actions: The user might manifest healing or protection, amplifying positive energy that boosts allies or strengthens defences.
     * For negative actions (or morally questionable): The user might invoke a backlash that harms the target, causing them to feel regret or weakness, like a wave of guilt or a physical weakening.
     The user’s abilities shift based on a target’s morality over time. If someone who has been “good” continues on a positive path, the effects could become more potent, while those with negative actions face escalating punishments or detriments.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Karma Surge:
     The user can trigger a surge of karmic energy that either blesses or curses the target based on their moral actions. This surge could have different effects based on the target’s behaviour in the past or present:
     * For the virtuous: A karmic blessing that amplifies the target’s natural abilities, boosting their strength, agility, or focus for a period of time. It could also have passive effects, like increasing luck or success.
     * For the morally ambiguous or evil: A karmic curse that saps their strength, causes instability, or weakens their resolve. The more morally questionable their actions, the harsher the curse (like minor damage or crippling effects on their abilities).
     The user could tap into the collective actions of the target (whether personal or broader actions in society), which alters the potency of the surge. This could be something the user "reads" or senses, allowing them to adapt the power to fit the situation.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Consequence Field:
     The user creates a field that responds to the actions or intentions of those who step into it. This field reacts to the surrounding individuals’ morality, offering benefits to those acting with good intentions and drawbacks to those who do harm. For example:
     * For good actions: The field can bolster health regeneration, grant temporary invulnerability, or shield against enemy attacks.
     * For bad actions: The field might cause an enemy to lose their will to fight, experience slowed movement, or suffer minor but constant damage as karmic energy eats away at them.
     The field grows stronger as more good-aligned individuals enter or perform positive actions, while it weakens the longer immoral acts persist in its vicinity, making it a tool of shifting power depending on the moral balance of the environment.
13. Ink:
     Power 1: Shadow Script:
     The user can summon tendrils or constructs made of shifting ink. These tendrils can bind enemies, act as weapons, or form shields. The ink constructs have a fluid, semi-solid quality, constantly shifting and writhing like living shadows. These constructs can shift forms mid-action, turning from binding tendrils into sharp spikes or expanding into a defensive dome. The ink leaves behind a residue that saps enemy energy, like a creeping corruption that spreads over time.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Abyssal Canvas:
     The user can flood an area with a spreading pool of liquid ink, turning the battlefield into a dark, viscous zone. Within this "canvas," the user has increased speed and precision, while enemies are slowed and disoriented as though moving through a liquid void. The ink pool gives the user the ability to “sink” into it, disappearing and re-emerging elsewhere, allowing for sudden strikes or escapes. Enemies caught in the ink also see illusions or hear whispers, further disorienting them.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Inkborn Wraiths:
     The user can summon inky, amorphous creatures that resemble shifting shadows or spectral figures. These wraiths act as temporary allies, harassing enemies with erratic movements and sharp, fluid strikes. They can phase through obstacles and dissolve into puddles of ink when destroyed, leaving behind hazardous zones that slow or damage enemies. The user can reshape the wraiths on the fly, turning them into defensive barriers, weapons, or even transportation (e.g; riding a larger wraith across the battlefield). The wraiths can also split into smaller forms to confuse enemies or swarm them.
14. Energy:
     Power 1: Kinetic Surge:
     The user can channel pure energy into their body, granting bursts of enhanced speed, strength, and reflexes. This makes them capable of rapid dashes, powerful strikes, or impossible agility, allowing them to weave through enemies and unleash devastating attacks. When fully charged, the user’s energy erupts outward, creating a shockwave that knocks back enemies and disrupts their formations. The energy lingers, crackling and sparking in the air, providing a temporary boost to allies’ speed or focus. The energy trails behind the user in vibrant, flowing arcs of light, glowing brighter as their speed or momentum increases.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Resonant Field:
     The user generates an energy field that pulses with harmonic frequencies, affecting the battlefield around them.
     * Allies within the field: Gain regeneration, increased stamina, or heightened focus, making their movements more fluid and precise.
     * Enemies within the field: Are disorientated by the fluctuating frequencies, slowing their reactions or causing their attacks to miss.
     The field expands over time, and the user can “tune” the energy to amplify certain effects - for instance, increasing disorientation for enemies and boosting energy recovery for allies.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Living Current:
     The user can summon streams of energy that flow like rivers through the air or along surfaces. These streams can take various forms:
     * Offense: They whip and strike like energy tendrils, damaging enemies on contact.
     * Control: They form barriers or loops that entangle and restrain enemies.
     * Support: They energize allies who touch them, temporarily boosting their speed or recovering stamina.
     The user can command the currents to flow through the battlefield, dynamically altering their course to chase down enemies or assist allies. The currents glow with a vibrant, almost liquid-like radiance, creating a stunning and intimidating visual.
15. Sound:
     Power 1: Resonant Call:
     The user can emit a sound that affects the emotions of those who hear it, with effects based on their intent:
     * Charming Tone: A melodic, entrancing call that soothes enemies, making them hesitate and lower their defences.
     * Frightening Tone: A dissonant, unsettling sound that strikes fear into enemies, causing them to panic, flee, or hesitate in their actions. The sound feels like it resonates in the bones, making it deeply unsettling.
     The sound adapts to the targets, becoming more harmonious and alluring for those susceptible to charm, or more grating and invasive for those vulnerable to fear. The range and intensity of the call grow with the character's focus.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Sonic Rift:
     The user unleashes a powerful burst of sound that deals physical damage by creating shockwaves. This could take different forms depending on the user's preference:
     * Focused Burst: A precise, directional soundwave that can knock enemies off their feet or shatter obstacles.
     * Area Shockwave: A radial blast of sound that affects multiple enemies, causing disorientation or direct damage.
     The shockwave can create lingering effects, like a ringing in enemies’ ears that disrupts their focus or balance. If amplified, the rift can destroy barriers or even destabilize the terrain.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Echo Mirage:
     The user manipulates sound to create illusions or misdirect enemies. By projecting false sounds or voices, they can confuse foes and manipulate their movements.
     * Charming Version: Project soothing or familiar sounds, like the voice of a loved one, to lure enemies into traps or distract them.
     * Frightening Version: Amplify terrifying noises, like roars or wails, to make enemies think they’re surrounded or being hunted.
     The mirages can become semi-tangible, appearing as faint, shimmering figures or shapes that add a visual element to the auditory trickery.
16. Blood:
     Power 1: Flesh Reaper:
     The user can expel bursts of their blood to create organic growths like spiked tendrils, sharp bone constructs, or parasitic vines. The creations are unnervingly organic, like jagged blades made of hardened bone or whips formed from sinewy tendrils. These creations can be used offensively to impale or entangle enemies, or defensively to shield the user. The growths are semi-living, capable of moving on their own for a short time, attacking nearby enemies or adapting to block incoming attacks. In addition, they can regenerate or reshape mid-battle, turning a blade into a spear or a whip into a shield. They also cause lingering pain or corruption to those they wound.
     
     Power 2: (Option 1) Viscera Transmutation:
     This power has two uses:
     * Offensive: The user sacrifices their own body mass to create grotesque, organic constructs, such as protective walls of flesh, skeletal barriers, or even temporary organic minions. These constructs dissolve into harmless matter when the ability ends. The constructs become semi-sentient, capable of independent action like defending key points or seeking out enemies to attack. The user’s body slowly regenerates the lost mass over time.
     * Defensive: The user can temporarily transfer their life essence to others, healing allies or boosting their physical capabilities, but at a cost. Overuse leaves the user physically weakened or drained. If the user sacrifices enough of their blood, they can imbue an ally with a temporary transformation, granting them monstrous strength or regenerative abilities.
     
     Power 2: (Option 2) Haemorrhage Field:
     The user creates a zone where they manipulate the blood of all living beings within. Enemies feel their blood turning sluggish, weakening their movements and causing disorientation, while the user’s blood flows faster, enhancing their speed and reaction time. The field causes the air to feel dense and heavy, with a faint mist of red swirling around as though drawn from the surroundings. At full power, the user can force enemies’ blood to burst from their wounds, causing additional damage or forcing them into retreat.
17. Crystal:
     Ability 1: Prismatic Bloom:
     The user generates jagged, crystalline spikes that erupt from the ground or nearby surfaces, damaging and trapping enemies in their shimmering embrace. The crystals grow in a fractal pattern, expanding to cover larger areas if left unchecked. The crystals reflect light, creating dazzling bursts that can disorient foes, or they can amplify sound, creating deafening reverberations to stun nearby enemies.
     
     Ability 2: (Option 1) Shard Storm:
     The user summons a swirling barrage of razor-sharp crystal shards that orbit around them before launching outward to cut through enemies. The shards can linger after striking, embedding themselves into surfaces or opponents. Embedded shards grow over time, restricting movement and causing ongoing damage.
     
     Ability 2: (Option 2) Diamond Veil:
     The user creates a swirling shield of crystalline fragments that orbit their body, deflecting attacks and damaging any foes who come too close. The veil can be shattered outward in an explosive burst, striking all enemies in its radius. The shards from the shattered veil remain embedded in the environment, forming a temporary barrier or hazardous terrain to control enemy movement.
18. Poison:
     Ability 1: Poison Synthesis:
     The user’s body naturally produces toxins or poisons, which can be excreted through their pores. These poisons can coat weapons, contaminate surfaces, or even be used in direct contact attacks. With focus, the user can control the potency and type of poison, choosing effects such as paralysis, slow-acting damage, or even hallucinations.
     
     Ability 2: (Option 1) Venom Slash:
     The user coats their blade with their own toxic blood, slashing at an enemy to create a splash effect. This splash extends beyond the blade’s reach, poisoning any enemies hit by it. The poison lingers on the ground, creating a hazardous area that damages or weakens foes who step into it.
     
     Ability 2: (Option 2) Ensnaring Miasma:
     The user releases a cloud of poisonous gas that infects the minds of those who inhale it. Victims become ensnared by the user’s influence, seeing their allies as enemies and attacking them uncontrollably.
19. Metal:
     Ability 1: Magnetic Arsenal:
     The user manipulates metallic objects in their surroundings, summoning them into a swarm of flying weapons or tools. These objects can strike enemies, form defensive shields, or reshape into utility constructs like bridges or ladders. The user can imbue the metals with kinetic energy, causing them to ricochet off surfaces for unpredictable, devastating attacks.
     
     Ability 2: (Option 1) Living Alloy:
     The user’s body becomes coated in a flexible, liquid-like metal that enhances their durability and strength. While active, they can morph the alloy into weapons, shields, or spikes to attack nearby foes. - The alloy can absorb impacts, reducing damage from physical attacks, and redirect the stored energy into powerful counterattacks.
     
     Ability 2: (Option 2) Forgebound Pillar:
     The user summons a towering pillar of molten-hot metal from the ground, which rapidly cools and solidifies. This pillar can be launched at enemies for massive damage or used to alter the battlefield by creating obstacles and platforms. The user can manipulate the pillar after its creation, causing it to splinter into shards or fold into new shapes, such as traps or defensive walls.
20. Tinted 'No Restraints':
21. No Restraints:

Once a flask is chosen, the holder cannot change their choice and that shall be one of the powers they possess for every set of Void Unique Armour and Weapon that the holder ever uses.
